1,In grand scheme thing Fight Club le group people like fight commercialism inherent society drive people edge The unnamed narrator Edward Norton join soapmaker Tyler Durden Brad Pitt found Project Mayhem whose goal undermine everything corporate Part modus operandi involves starting fistfight But point narrator realizes going farand he helpless stop madnessFight Club certainly one best movie Not fullscale indictment commercialism also acting script direction topnotch This movie one best example modern classic,Positive
2,To honest I saw title movie I thought going another mindless action film But something happenedI actually watched I thought movie genius It wasnt much fighting It schizofrenic office worker suffered insomnia Brad Pitt star movie played character Tyler Durden flawlessly Throughout movie Ed Nortons character narrator trying fight inner demon preventing getting sleep With help several small terrorist group disturbed female pretended suffer testicular cancer Tyler Durden self righteous psycho narrator finally resolve problem I feel I would enjoyed movie much brother spoiled damn ending I watched even without surprise ending Fight Club still make top,Negative
3,Fight Club isnt bad movie nearly good people make beIt really come pretentious piece work film student study point exhaustion I dont think ever intended The movie play key alteration scenebyscene retelling book sometimes going far lift paragraph inner monologue directly novel plopping scriptIts movie requires least two viewing beyond get boring pretty big hurry Particularly toward end second actbeginning third painfully bland boring difficult care anything thats happening around whole Project Mayhem stuff Its difficult maintain kind focus throughoutTheres lot stuff hidden movie people go back revisit inessential Honestly looked back Easter egg leaf question care And course unpopular opinion I held reviewing title honest hope multiple viewing would raise rating I even read Palahniuks novel try derive additional meaning itWithout giving away ending make think creates nice gimmick get people watch I said beyond Im perfectly happy close chapter one leave pastThe first rule fight club dont talk fight club And Im happy done talking one good long,Positive
4,Similar idea American Beauty certainly style content bleak look underground culture spiritual redemption brings easily one intelligent film Ive ever seen Directed man brought u superb The Game another film youll see truly understand Focusing sad whitecollar middleclass Norton whose real dream life content IKEA catalogue follows chance meeting charismatic stranger Pitt unfortunate event conspire draw together After night hard drinking start friendlyish scrap viewed couple others small acorn mighty oak called Fight Club grows This point around whole film revolves Norton Pitt forming underground club draw disillusioned young men join Based firm Queensbury Rules cathartic bloody way spend night Eventually becomes huge operation Pitt de facto leader move gear creates cult secret society This film becomes brilliant twist near end magnificent better even much talked The Sixth Sense It much say thing emasculation entire generation young men No great war fight great depression growing isolation feel one another need find something draw u back together importantly power exciting challenging idea fermentation cultism However many film would say This bad thing Fight Club doesnt It condemnation materialistic society forgotten large section You empathise men completely even band together uncaring society reared something instinct dont understand Its close genius youll get one film youll talk think day,Positive
5,The Fight Club movie like successful equally troubled cousin The Matrix philosophical theme originality presentation also strong satire Another movie similar way vastly superior intelligent fun American Psycho The plot adapted eponymous book borrows idea Dostoevskys The Double put Thus spoke Zarathustra along way It derivative good certainly good cult follower would suggest In case given hype I expecting There good point along way especially anticipation terrorism good transformational scene like confronting bos overall come across much shallow reputation would suggest It high style influence lot idea crammed might even revolutionary respect time like Matrix I also find bit missing perhaps worth watch perfect masterpiece assume It may seem perhaps teen incels millenials successful sophisticated rendering idea Tone expectation give try movie work bit piece originality sometimes given WAY much credit,Positive
6,A dark comedy cult following Director David Fincher take Chuck Palaniuks novel maybe harsher dangerous place Known The NarratorEdward Nortonis corporate employee longer enchanted elaborate apartment expensive furnishing pretty much disenfranchised life concerned lack ability sleep He attends selfhelp group relish miserable people surrounding He meet suicidal Marla SingerHelena Bonham Carter want distance Life changing meeting soap salesman Tyler DurdenBrad Pitt anarchy poster child Durden thrives roguish rebel convinces The Narrator staging impromptu boxing match parking lot deserted building basement These match bare chested bare knuckle The fighter beat living crap one yell stop Durden credited starting fight club across nation eventually turn club aggression laden prankster releasing malice corporate AmericaBrutal violence strong language expected along pretty graphic image Also cast Meat Loaf David Andrews Zach Grenier Jared Leto Eion Bailey,Negative

208,Fight Club Academy Award nominated sound effect movie roughly year ago starring Edward Norton twotime Academy Award nominee turned Brad Pitt Meat Loaf Helena Bonham Carter Its possibly famous movie director David Fincher although far best opinion That mean bad film Not However many character simply top film constant danger surpassing fine line entertainment ridiculousness Its based Palahniuk novel known script come Jim Uhls surprisingly insignificant career coming word cult filmThe dialog witty almost hip occasionally Its film easily offended people tends vulgar time violence graphic frequently although certainly surprise film titled Fight Club In general pretty insane film time good way The fact two character visit meeting dying people feel better pretty much say already I clearly preferred Norton Pitt selfexplanatory Pitt get single award nomination work He becomes pretty much caricature time Then character really exist used kind justification I guess The final plot twist come unexpected reminded one The Usual Suspects main character still unaware true identity By way Norton looked pretty much age film year later scored another Oscar nomination work Best Picture winnerThe ending pretty great though I liked disappearance Pitt gunshot finally see also darker side Nortons character Bonham Carters character watch explosion But gunshot little damage Did pain make Pitts character go away Anyway Fight Club good movie Not one personal favorite entertaining minute almost never drag One favorite scene near end police station get interrogated almost emasculated That pretty funny also shocking time RecommendedThe review February summer I got chance give another watch I add thought It almost year old fact two million people rated imdb really selfexplanatory This film become cult classic sure I brainstorming This time I really wan na mention Meat Loaf sadly longer u anymore May rest peace He played truly extravagant character sport background substance abuse eventually resulted boob hormonotherapy forced go battle cancer Interestingly enough survived least die cancer could think would Meat Loafs character one really could ruined movie wrong approach thanks Fincher mostly right approach work Jared Leto also film really light hair I think platinum blonde term yeah find musician playing supporting character Letos screen time really limited I already mentioned interrogation scene earlier I must also say shocking yet entertaining time said knew would say alter ego Tyler Durden told would We never really see Norton durdenesque state want call briefly flashback twist revealed Blink gone though Like scene Bonham Carters character sex Yep Helena Bonham Carter romantic interest film character pretty much object desire A bit difficult imagine personal taste I mean Tim Burton loved even romance started year film I also see Spanish root apparently Okay I know thatAs film I must also say I still think song end Where Is My Mind good also much older sound like Really nice way close film see catastrophe happen This already done evolved Fight Club got different name something mayhem I like change much even member uttering rule like robot bit entertaining side film never really comedy still make smile situational comedy On dramatic side I still struggling big twist end Not Nortons character somehow survives shot head know end seems like rule apply anymore also especially Norton real Tyler Durden even I liked depicted see scene featured Pitt feature Durden say For example towards guy kidnap brief moment threaten something ugly testicle Also darkly comedic reference back cancer group much earlier Oh yeah word shouting Meat Loafs character dy also kinda funny exactly Nortons character mind got message wrong I liked actorcharacter one scene crucial scene barkeeper something asked Nortons character important question barkeeper show hand take u back maybe violent scene destructive liquid put somebody hand cause irreparable damage act friendship somehow act finding strength suffering In good way even Difficult explainBut let really go I wanted talk The scene early involved Nortons Pitts character I talking phone call I talking two street fighting violently yet playfully moment Fight Club begin exist others come watch Would come impressed one guy going crazy nobody else around Or conversation airplane first meeting Or Pitts character driving car Nortons next I hard time acknowledge scene actually included one character fact So I guess way see scene simply way Nortons character harmless side remembers happen Not like This could also emphasized inclusion voiceovers We really witnessing film reality may completely different actual reality Or sometimes even exactly We never really say sure But also good indicator example Pitts character told Nortons talk Bonham Carters character Despite two constantly sex Nortons character perspective Or could really police officer interrogation room part started Fight Club Difficult imagine also nobody outside watching action Or nobody really following Nortons character ran gun hand So yeah amount scene play mind endless maybe understand film little bit better viewing maybe wont make progress That perfectly fine though This film also enjoyed crassness individual scene necessary grasp concept behind overall thing From personal perspective I would also like say I thought nice see two actor I mistaken later became part Dark Angel one favorite show ever worked Fincher little later James Cameron I talking bos office also one cop actor I
