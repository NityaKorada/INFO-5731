            "FIGHT CLUB / (1999) ***Viewing \"Fight Club,\" the new drama by assertive director David Fincher, is like walking through graffiti-laden streets of a crime-ridden suburban city; it is dark, brutal, gritty, troublesome, and hostile. This film is all of those things, but in this circumstance I use such adjectives to the production's credit. \"Fight Club\" is a coarse, unpleasing journey into the lives of its narcotic characters, but it is for those exact same reasons why I find myself recommending the movie to audiences with strong stomachs. If this film was anything but what I have already described, we would be appalled at such deserving controversy and violent content contained. The hostility of  \"Fight Club\" is the main factor of which why it succeeds; the raucous style contributes in making a convincing, entertaining, and recklessly original story.Edward Norton stars as the movie's narrator, an insomniac spending his petty days working in an office and sleepless nights seeking out clinics in which he provides comfort to those less fortunate than he. One of the people he meets is an overweight but gentle pedestrian named Robert Paulson (Meat Loaf), a victim of testicular cancer. He also meets a sleazy, foul-mouthed drifter like himself named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter).Norton's character development is quite unusual; although effective and versatile, the introduction, as is with the rest of the movie, is extremely bleak. It is as if the characters are creating an anti-society story through some perverse behaviors. We witness the movie through the Narrator's point of view, who ends up explaining more of the plot than necessary.During a plane flight, our undervalued narrator encounters a cocky and well-dressed soap sales representative named Tyler Durden (Brat Pit), whose sarcastic and outspoken notions create a charisma between both individuals. Shortly afterwards, the Narrator's apartment blows apart, leaving him nowhere to seek shelter but with Tyler. This enigmatic man then organizes an underground sensation called Fight Club, in which young men inquire pleasure out of beating each other into bloody carnage. This secret society, located in the basement of a local bar, allows its members to find self-discovery and freedom through brawls and scuffles.\"Fight Club\" is crafted stirringly from structured innovation to production designs. Art director Chris Gorak, production designer Alex McDowell, and cinematographer Jeff Cornenweth capture the film's subversive atmosphere with vivid detail and descriptive style and dazzling lighting techniques. Costume designs by Michael Kaplan contribute to the development of Tyler Durden with distinctive, creative outfits.David Fincher is currently one of my favorite directors. His striking and suspenseful thrillers \"The Game\" and \"Seven\" captured my attention thoroughly with sharp characters and focused narratives. \"The Game\" detailed a wealthy executive immersed in confederacy who must overcome a variety of challenges to survive. \"Fight Club\" is more or less the same topic, in which a rebellious benefactor assists in taking charge of his lack of freedom through violent encounters. This production contains plot twists and a climatic resolution that may require more reasoning and thought than the majority of an audience will be willing to submit.\"Fight Club\" contains enough extreme graphic violent content for several movies, yet few characters end up with severe injuries. When a tough young man beats someone's face into the ground, resulting in so much gore he is hardly recognizable, you would expect that person to end up in critical condition at the hospital. However, many characters in this movie engage in uncultivated attacks but appear in modest condition the following day. I guess this movie centers more on its theme than the character's actual course of action, which is obligatory for success.Brad Pitt captures Tyler Durden with a macho, politically incorrect attitude; he is the right choice for his character, with a hunky physical appearance and appropriate style, this is one of the actor's career peak performances. Edward Norton proves he is more qualified in productions like this and \"American History X\" rather than light-hearted romantic comedies like \"Keeping The Faith.\" He apprehends the difficult character with proficiency and sophisticated detail.\"Fight Club\" is one of the more difficult movies I have reviewed in quite a while. With its contentious messages, studio hype, audience anticipation, and the actual film itself, you are reading a strenuously written critique. My reaction to this movie was a mixture between startling amazement and baffling perplexity, furthermore, \"Fight Club\" is a production containing ideas audiences will be discussing long after its finale; it is the kind of movie that may require seconds helpings for some inquiring viewers.\n",

            "Fight Club' is a superb filmmaking achievement.  It is brutal, innovative, raw, realistic, and extremely powerful.  You could not ask more from the actors.  Edward Norton once again portrays a psyche in delicate imbalance with potent and believable intensity.  Brad Pitt moves to the far side of diabolical and excels in making his character both warped and charismatic. Helena Bonham Carter also shines as the Tyler's pathetic and parasitic girl friend.Fight Club' takes some of the most pernicious elements of societal dysfunction and wraps them up into a single imaginative well crafted and entertaining film.  We have elements of gang behavior, cultism, anarchy, terrorism and debauchery all glorified in the name of iconoclasm.  Exciting, seductive and subversive.  How utterly cool and hip!So now comes the twist.  I hated this film.  It is a monument to everything that is wrong with filmmaking today.  It is clever and technically superb but philosophically and socially bereft.  Its attempt at social satire, while effective and visceral, was destructive and noxious.  I also can't help but notice the extreme irony of using satire against consumerism as the theme for inducing the masses to buy tickets to consume your film.At what point does a film cross the line between art and depravity?  Fight Club' is a brilliant but dangerous film that begs the question.  If art is a reflection of a society's culture and values, then when I look at this film I have to be frightened at what is staring back at me.  When I reflect on some of the most popular films of the last five years, I can't help but notice the accelerating celebration of random and impulsive violence, depravity, decadence, and pure bad taste.  Fight Club' has pushed the envelope once again to find a new pinnacle (or should I say nadir) in the portrayal of these corrosive elements of societal dissolution.It's comical how many people think it is avant-guard to attack the establishment, as if this is a concept only recently conceived.  Fight Club' is just the latest rallying cry to anarchy in a long line of such cries that have plagued society throughout human history.  It always seems to be a romantic notion for everyone to be totally free and just live `naturally' (like animals) until one of those animals decides that it is you whom it might be fun to kill today.  It doesn't seem to occur to those who extol the sardonic message of such films, that they simultaneously promote and lionize societal destabilization, and that anarchy and mayhem are much less fun in real life than when you are watching them in the air conditioned comfort of your local movie house.  Just ask the kids at Columbine High School.I like dark movies as much or more than the next guy, but this film simply goes too far.  There is nothing wrong with criticizing the establishment. Constructive criticism is the only way to bring about progressive change. But this film is merely vulgar cynicism that suggests that mayhem is preferable to imperfect culture.  That is grossly irresponsible.So I am placed in the paradoxical position of admiring this film while I must condemn it.  As a flickjunkie I must stand in awe of it as a filmmaking accomplishment.  But as a human being concerned with the greater good of the species, I must cry out against it.  How far are we willing to go in the name of entertainment?  Are we so myopic as to demand entertainment at any cost?  I guess we will see when someone raises the ante and the next shock treatment comes to a theater near you.\n",

            "In David Fincher's controversial and outstanding Fight Club, Edward Norton plays a person whose name we never find out. He has no life: he has a dead-end job, he orders IKEA furniture mail-order, and he becomes addicted to self-help groups. But Marla Singer (Helena Bohnam Carter) also goes to his groups, and the Narrator's condo gets burned down. And then he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).Tyler sells soap. And so the Narrator moves in with Tyler, and they soon find out that they have masochistic pleasures and start a \"Fight Club\". Every Saturday night people can pummel each other for fun. And the Narrator's life turns topsy-turvey.Lotsa fights, action scenes, dark humor, and awesome acting. Norton was exceptional as the Narrator. He really brought out the dullness of the character he was trying to show. Great job. Pitt was good but nothing to write home about. He did manage to tell us that he does have some acting talent, but wouldn't be half as famous if he was ugly. Carter really displayed some strong acting here. The supporting cast, including Meat Loaf and Jared Leto, has strong potential (yes, even Meat Loaf!).There was, in the superbly written script, a lot of dark humor. The early scenes, such as the Narrator and Marla arguing over which groups to attend, had a lot of the humor. The script, which enjoys to have great speeches by Pitt, was so well written. The over narration (which dominates most of the film) was excellent. I can't really describe it, there are no words.The movie works best when it's at its trippiest. The ending twist (which I unfourtanatly read about before) went out in more directions that I had thought. If there is one major flaw, it is that Fight Club doesn't really have a real plot. The opening part of the film is about the Narrator's life. The second part is the Fight Club. The third part is the scheme that Tyler has to branch off from Fight Club. And the final part is the ending. The excessive violence, in my opinion, was necessary to the movie and I wouldn't have cut anything out.Fight Club is an extremly entertaining movie with great acting and stunning visuals.My rating: 8/10Rated R for strong violence, language, terrorist acts, and some sexuality.\n",

            "Here's a movie that pretends to condemn violence (by the end, Tyler Durden is unmistakeably a villain), but it makes fighting look so cool that thousands of people have misinterpreted its message.  Maybe I'm being too harsh here; I've met two people who were inspired to start random fights because of this movie, and that really irritates me (especially since they took pokes at me!).  However, I do think that a fatally flawed message is enough to sink a film, even a great film, and this is not quite a great film.Oh yeah, there's social commentary in this movie...commentary for angry 15 year olds.  Okay, commercial society stinks, so we should rebel, we should reform popular culture by...by...going to the basement and punching each other out?  No, that doesn't strike me as a viable solution.  Even the movie knows this, and it does some quick back-pedaling at the end and tells us not to trust Durden...but he's been the hero all along!So, in the end, the film points out problems but offers no solutions.  It generates anger, but channels it in the wrong direction.  It's clever, but it's not actually smart.  It's satirical, but it doesn't have a point. Violence is good, until it kills Meatloaf, and then violence is bad.  Sorry, it doesn't work.As for the film's actual style...gross, innit?  So, I ask myself - why watch a gross movie with a flawed message?  Good question.  The answer is, don't watch it, and go find an actually good, actually wise movie instead.\n",

Edward Norton played the best rule for him in that Great movie .. He is a sick man , who suffers from insomnia and that makes him out of the balance .. so , He sees strange persons , things & slept in a place to wake up in another place so, he says \"Was I Sleep ?! .. Have I Slept ?! \" .. a doctor advised him to visit conferences of people who suffer from cancer to see how they pain , To feel that he is better than many people .. he went and find himself cry with cancer victims and he able to sleep ! and events follows to find a big surprise during the movie ! .. Brad Pitt too , played one of the best rules for him .. He played a man who is a clever , rude and dangerous and he want to make a monster from the sick man \"Edward Norton\" .. Really both of them played their rules as magicians ! I think that great movie didn't get his right in Osacr 2000 .. because, there were many great movies with it in that year as \"The Matrix\" , \"The Sixth Sense\" and \"American Beauty\" .. but , in the fact .. i see that Edawrd , Brad & David Finsher should nominataed for Oscars about that great wonderful movie . About the music .. I'll say wow ! .. The sound track is a magical , Espesially Ost about \"Finding The Bomb\" . I give that great movie 10 out of 10 .. and I see It worth more than 10 ! Really, It's one of the best movies that you will see .. It places number \"21\" of the top 250 movies now .. but ' I see it must be between the first \"15\" .. You must see this amazing movie . Finally , I'll say on the way of \"Edward Norton\" in that great movie : \"Was I Sleep ?! .. Have I slept ?!! \" .. And I'll answer : Yes, I think that i was sleeping ! .. because, I didn't watch an ordinary movie ! .. but , I watched a dream !!\n",

            "its one of the best movies i have ever seen  i really wonder  how edward norton  brad pitt were not nominated for oscars about their rules in that great movie   and how the genius director david fincher wasnt nominated as the best director about this wonderful movie  edward norton played the best rule for him in that great movie  he is a sick man  who suffers from insomnia and that makes him out of the balance  so  he sees strange persons  things  slept in a place to wake up in another place so he says was i sleep   have i slept    a doctor advised him to visit conferences of people who suffer from cancer to see how they pain  to feel that he is better than many people  he went and find himself cry with cancer victims and he able to sleep  and events follows to find a big surprise during the movie   brad pitt too  played one of the best rules for him  he played a man who is a clever  rude and dangerous and he want to make a monster from the sick man edward norton  really both of them played their rules as magicians  i think that great movie didnt get his right in osacr   because there were many great movies with it in that year as the matrix  the sixth sense and american beauty  but  in the fact  i see that edawrd  brad  david finsher should nominataed for oscars about that great wonderful movie  about the music  ill say wow   the sound track is a magical  espesially ost about finding the bomb  i give that great movie  out of   and i see it worth more than   really its one of the best movies that you will see  it places number  of the top  movies now  but  i see it must be between the first   you must see this amazing movie  finally  ill say on the way of edward norton in that great movie  was i sleep   have i slept    and ill answer  yes i think that i was sleeping   because i didnt watch an ordinary movie   but  i watched a dream \n",

Also, no need to mention the amazing direction. The movie is as good as it gets. It's stylish, fun and thrilling. As a mental health professional, I vouch for the intend of the movie and the areas that it tried to breakthrough. The leads are amazing in their respective roles. We must understand that the movie had something that we as viewers wanted to see in a movie, something cathartic about the characters and something dangerous and adventurous that we somehow wanted to see as a projection rather than seeing ourselves being in the situation. It's done a good job expressing the duality of human psyche, exploring the suppressed and unexpressed self in the characters in the movie. Overall a fine movieWhat did not work:\n",
            "Some minor flaws are evident in the movie, which are not serious to mar the narrative. Also, the place that they live is awful, not as a set but as a place which means the makers have done their job fine. It's filthy and very nasty which was the intend afterall. I would have appreciated if I as a viewer knew more about this main character, this person, his complication in life and his psychological experience before getting into the ride into the fight club. Besides his insomnia we do not know much to tell us he has some major life stressors or something bothering him in his reality to vent into someone else. That would have been great. Or maybe as a mental health professional, I would have appreciated if the makers wrote a little bit different dialogues to convey his hallucinations and how to deal it other than the steps he take.

            "Fight Club (1999)Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Jared Leto, Meat Loaf, Zach Grenier.Directed by David Fincher.Spoilers herein.I admit, when I first rented Fight Club about two years ago, I was pretty disappointed. But the reason I probably was is because it was a very different film that I had seen from others. Friends had recommended it to me saying that I would either love or hate it, but I found myself stuck in the middle. Considering that it had a high rating on the IMDb's Top 250 movies, and all of the hype that was surrounding it, I knew that I had to see it.One of the things that I didn't care for in Fight Club the first time I saw it was that I missed most of the satire and black-comedy behind the violence. However, the whole movie did have an interesting yet strange feel to it. About a year ago, I re-watched the film to see if I would find anything different about it. While watching it, I liked it much more than I did the second time. I caught more of the black humor, and it was hypnotically entertaining.The story begins with an executive (Edward Norton, playing a character without a name 'Narrator') whose bored with his life and can't sleep during the nights. He begins going to testicular cancer groups so it would make him feel better, but he can't sleep while a lady who fakes her cancer (Helena Bonham Carter playing Marla Singer) remains at the group. After his condo explodes, he is taken in by a mysterious soap salesman (Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden) who shows him a bizarre form of therapy which they call the \"Fight Club\".'Fight Club' isn't an easy movie to talk about, write about or forget about. It works in such brilliant ways that other films don't, and in the end the movie works on almost every level. In the sense of storytelling, it definitely succeeds. It was probably the most talked about movie of 1999, and there was much to say about it.One could say that 'Fight Club' is laughably over-the-top, or to say that the film itself doesn't make sense. I began to think that until it all caught up with me in the end. I will not give any spoilers why it did, but I wasn't really expecting a surprise. It could be compared to the bizarre style of films like Stanley Kubrick's 'Clockwork Orange', Oliver Stone's 'Natural Born Killers' and Terry Gilliam's 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'. But there's so much chemistry and psychological attitude put to this movie that you may not be able to \"get\" it the first time around. It's a social satire that has almost everything I'd look for in one.I can't really say that I thought this was directed David Fincher's best film (I enjoyed Se7en (1995) more), but this definitely makes a case as his most visual and daring film. He gives a great direction once again, gives the whole movie a very vivid feel.One of the only bad things that I can actually say about this film is some of the very strong violence (one scene in particular involving Norton and Jared Leto's character fighting) and a lot of people might think that it would lead to a pointless ending and the average viewer would be left with a negative message. But that isn't the way that it's supposed to end. You really do have to think beyond the movie, no matter how much it doesn't seem real.Since I loved Edward Norton's performance in 'American History X', he once again gives a great performance and background narration. Brad Pitt gives possibly his best performance to date, and the supporting roles are also good.The violence is probably the most controversial part of the movie. While I didn't find it too extreme, I thought that others who hadn't seen it should be aware of it. I found a lot of Fight Club quite amusing and funny, but it does get more effective toward the end. The anti-socialism in the film isn't told in a mean-spirited or hated way, the people fighting each other to released energy and power out on one another. But after its all over, you begin to realize how scary the film really is, and apocalyptic it would be in real-life. But the film is still humorous and isn't meant to be as serious as it is.I never read the book with the same title by Chuck Palahnuik, but after seeing the movie I am interested in reading it. Definitely one of the best films of 1999 along with 'American Beauty' and 'Magnolia'. To sum it all up, 'Fight Club' is one of the best viewing experiences I've ever had in my life, and one of the rare films that kept me entertained on several repeated viewings. It's a riveting, dazzling and completely original story that didn't leave my mind for a while. 4.5 out of 5 stars.\n",

            "Fight Club definitely has style and is exciting to watch, with complex characters driven by their actions and a great plot twist at the end. The actors were all good, and Fincher does a good job of maintaining consistency in what's really happening and showing the narrator's perspective. As always with adaptations, some interesting exposition in details is lost, such as how exactly Tyler did his work at night and how Project Mayhem worked. The ending, which is so beloved, works and makes sense but isn't exceptional. Why does Tyler die when the narrator shoots his cheek - because he finally takes control of his life, because he's no longer afraid? It's plausible and there's nothing wrong with it, but it certainly didn't blow me away. There are plenty of good themes, and the contrasts of Tyler and the narrator as opposing extremes in problems with society were enjoyable to consider. I don't think there was anything wrong with Fight Club, but I also don't think it's anything more than a decent movie with a good twist.\n",

            "This movie is about a troubled man who meets a stranger and they decide to open up an underground boxing club which eventually grows out of control. The movie is dark and unorthodox. The brutality helps drive the movie and it shows how a simple fighting group can go out of control and take a dramatic turn. It has a surprising twist ending which will knock you out cold. It was very surprising and I liked the choice it made. The movie gives clues throughout the movie that most if not all people would miss the first viewings which leaves room for re-watching it. Every time I give it another viewing, there is always something new to be found. Many people might turn away when they see the brutality but it didn't bother me. What makes this movie so special is that it dared to go where no film has ever attempted to go before and that's what makes it so special. I think that this is one of the best movies of the 90's. Its creativity can inspire hours of discussing and it will be a film which will probably age well.\n",

It's another in a line of effective points of zeitgeist for modern counter-culture (The Matrix, Donnie Darko, etc.) and all that jazz, but it is effective.

            "This is really a great movie! Until now, I've never thought much of Brad Pitt as an actor, but as Tyler Durden, in this movie he shows what he can do. So did Edward Norton as some Average Joe with no life, Bonham Carter as Marla Singer who've I've seen before in Howard's End, another movie I like and I recall she performed very well.But now about this movie . . . It was pure brilliance. Imagine yourself living a dull boring life as a nobody, feeling life is passing you by as many of us have at some time. Be careful, you might do as this Average Joe and find through a most peculiar way an alter ego that is everything that you are not, but something you cannot control and something that can become more powerful and more dangerous than anything you could have ever imagined. Be careful! I won't go further with this! There is not much more that I can say without depriving you of this experience of losing yourself in the mazes that this movie took me. This movie will overtake you, it will exceed your ability to outwit and figure out where it is taking you and how it is taking you it is taking you there and why. It will take you as it does this sorry nobody. So I won't go further. Just see this movie and discover a nightmare, though so amusing at times you will roll on the floor laughing, as this movie is not without thought provoking and most profound of humor. Unlike comedies, this movie doesn't struggle or aim for laughs, the situations render themselves fertile grounds for them.This movie has no equals. It is a one of a kind. It's unlikely they'll make another one like it. Enjoy it. The best! My rating 10/10.\n",

The film covers every bit of angst dripping off the pages of the novel. Its quick edits and clever film-making is something to revel in, still after multiple viewings. It's dark, it's hilarious and the plot is one hell of a ride.The characters are fantastic, as are the actors portraying them. Edward Norton does a fantastic job as the everyman sucked into a dark underworld. Helena Bonham Carter shines as Marla Singer with some of the best dialogue in the film. This of course coming behind perhaps, the greatest character created, in film, novels and the whole world. I am of course talking about Tyler Durden. Masterfully portrayed by Brad Pitt, Tyler is a dangerous, sneaky but ultimately, cool customer.This film will capture every part of you with every time you watch it. If it doesn't, there is something clinically wrong with you.\n",

            "What can you say about a film, whose ideals center on anti-consumerism and rebellion/anarchy. I'm sure most people have wished for simpler times in their life, especially when confronted with an increasingly hectic, fast-paced, and technology-centric society. Fight Club aims to make that a reality.Fight Club center on Edward Nortons character, lets just call him Jack. Someone who is half yuppie/ half Starbucks frappucino corporate drone that the 20th century seem to churn out in alarming numbers. Jack suffers from what a lot of Americans suffer from disillusionment with themselves and their problems. Jack also fixes this ailment the way corporate America has told Jack to do so, buying more crap. Soon enough Jack can't sleep, something is wrong. Then comes Tyler Durden, who changes Jacks entire view on life. Jack wasn't just suffering from insomnia he was comatose, unable to see the world for what it really is. Then comes Fight Club and some uncanny relevations about himself and the world he has created unfolds. This is the essence of Fight Club.The reason this is so influential is because while your watching this film you can't help but relate. Everyone at some point in their life has felt empty, hollow. I guess, Fight Club is at its best an eye-opener. Never has America's consumer greed been put under such a microscope and examined in such an artistic and mesmerizing way.Fight Club at its heart is an \"F#$% You\" to modern society and the measuring yard it has created to measure your own self worth. Fight Club aims to liberate the viewer from the confines of the metaphorical jail of American idealism and societal control measures. It aims in the only way you can really get someone to understand, a bone-crushing punch to the face.\n",

            "\"Fight Club\" is a great film. It's the first film by David Fincher where I have left the cinema feeling rather uplifted and happy, and it's the first film by Fincher that I think is really, really good. It starts right at the opening credits: it's probably the best opening credits I have ever seen (yes, better than Se7en's).I had read Chuck Palahniuk's novel a couple of times before I saw the film and I like it (the novel) even if it's far from a masterpiece. Even though I like the book, the film is absolutely brilliant in its own right. Jim Uhls's script is fantastic. The comedy is also great, it's been a long time since I've laughed this much during a film. The cinematography is great, the music is perfect for the film, the dialogue is brilliant.The acting is, of course, top notch. Brad Pitt is often overlooked as an actor because of the famous face and the famous body. This is a shame, because I think he's a really good actor although this is the first time I think he's great. Helena Bonham Carter is, surprisingly, perfectly cast. I could see no other actress portraying Marla Singer. Meat Loaf is good as well. I could go on and on about Edward Norton, but that will probably bore you so let's just say that, even though this isn't another Aaron Stampler- or Derek Vinyard mind-blowing performance, he is an acting genius and that his performance in \"Fight Club\" is brilliant.The production design is another thing that is worth mentioning as something really good. As everybody will probably realise there is a \"but\" here and it's coming now: there is sadly a rather boring part in the film right before the brilliant last 10-15 minutes. It lasts for about 20 minutes and it slows down the film and makes it rather unbelievable (to those who have seen the film; I'm not referring to the most apparent thing when I say that some of it is unbelievable). Well, it's such a shame because if those twenty minutes had been more concentrated or something I would without a doubt have given this film a 10 here at IMDb. As it is now, I gave it an 9 after much consideration. Very close to being *incredibly* brilliant, as it is now \"Fight Club\" is \"only\" brilliant.\n",

The reason I think a lot of people like this movie is because the main character is very relatable. We all wanna be heard, we all want to have a small purpose in life, we're all tired of conformity and want to rebel against it and we all have this ideal image of what we want to be like (Tylor was like that for the narrator). Which is why the Fight Club was created, because he was so numb from his life and his insomnia didn't help that he wanted to fight if only it meant that he would feel something from it. The plot was absolutely amazing, and the plot twist just sealed the deal. The casting is so perfect, I can't imagine any other actors doing it better than them. A classic man, and if you are holding off watching it because you think it's too mainstream and overrated then you need to suck it up and watch it. You'll love the unique theme.\n",

            "Jack (Edward Norton) is looking for a cure. He suffers from insomnia, from an overdose of Starbucks and IKEA, and from overall apathy. Desensitized by a super-structured life, Jack seeks change by joining a series of support groups for victims of alcohol or cancer, and surrenders himself to the notion of physical pain, emotional release and consolation. His newfound peace, however, is disrupted when the eccentric Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) enters the groups but remains detached; a distraction which threatens to break Jack's secure sense of belonging. Jack's identity crisis is intensified by the introduction of Tyler (Brad Pitt), a soap maker and leader of the \"Fight Club\", the most violent support group he is tempted to join.A film about the urge to \"reorganize the world\" through violence, Fight Club recalls the young \"droogs\" in Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, yet it exchanges the previous film's theatrics for an internalized --or rather, visceral-- aesthetic. Fight Club benefits from a versatile camera, whose extreme close-ups, extreme long shots, worm's-eye view shots, bird's-eye view shots, freeze frames, slow motion and special effects explore the destabilization and the de-structuring of the protagonist's reality.Fight Club includes one of the greatest, if not the greatest (The Sixth Sense?), twists in cinema history.  It is for that reason, that I suggest Fight Club be remembered as a truly great piece of cinematography.\n",

            "David Fincher pulls out all the cinematic tricks in Fight Club. We get long shots that pull out from deep within a character, and I do mean deep and we get reality distorted so much that when reality comes back into focus, it's almost like getting slapped in the face.  It's hard to talk about Fight Club without giving away its surprises.  All I can say is see, it for yourself.  The movie is complex and you'll be thinking about it after you've left the theater.  Brad Pitt is at his best when he plays unhinged characters.  Here, he gets to be unhinged and I think he's perfect in this role.  He gets to be a bad boy and we revel in all of his guerilla tactics.  I liked the trick he does while working at a movie theater.  For all of the violence in Fight Club, there is only one death.  None of the brawlers fight to the death.  They might get beaten to a bloody pulp, but they live to fight another day.  What do you expect from a movie that's called Fight Club?\n",

            "The title suggests a random beat em up, the film is far from it. In fact, the film is a masterpiece of intelligence and features a script so descriptive it makes every line sound like a quote. The opening theme tune by Nine-Inch Nails is terrific and gives you the vibe needed to watch the rest of this astonishing movie. Edward Norton is a low-life. His life consists of what is in his kitchen and the testicular cancer group he gets addicted to ( even though he does not have testicular cancer.) Then he meets Brad Pitt, a soap salesman who has a completely different style of life, together, they create fight club, a club for men who want to get rid of stress by beating the crap out of each other and completing destructive \"homework\" assignments. The word of fight club spreads and soon, there are clubs starting all over the world. But as the fight club turns into more of a destructive group of hooligans, people begin to get in deep trouble and the truth is soon revealed. A great film that has to be seen twice to be appreciated. 10 out of 10.\n",

            "This movie can be miss construed as a perpetuator of violence, but the movie is a tough showcase of manhood, where men take it out on each other all in the name of the thrill of adrenalin. It takes a while to get into loving Fight Club, but the moment you are hooked, it will be one movie you will like to own. The movie showcased a good cinematography, as most of the events in the movie took place at night, the director and the cinematographer had to make the best of extra florescent lights, and using locations that had well lighted street lights.Fight Club is based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. The film was directed by David Fincher (Seven (1995) and The Curious Case of Benjamin Franklin (2008) both also stared Brad Pitt) the movie has an unnamed narrator which is played by Edward Norton. The narrator (Norton) tells us about his life, we learn about his white collar job and how he lived an everyday routine life which he got tired of, took break off the routine he started something that became so big that he himself could not control.The Unnamed narrator started a club with his new friend from a bar Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), the club featured men taking it out on each other, fighting bare fist just for the thrill.The club grew and became a cross country thing, with Tyler and the unnamed narrator seen as the club presidents and they take turns going around to see that the club is well run, in the various locations.Prepping up for their roles both Pitt and Norton took lessons in boxing, taekwondo, grappling and soap making. Pitt further went ahead to Chip some of his tooth so as not to look too perfect. Filming lasted over 138 days with over 300 scenes, the fight scenes were heavily choreographed with the actors going all out, so as to make it look more realistic.Here is a movie that I highly recommend you get the DVD, but I do have to warn you that it does posses extreme violence, as we see men go bear fist fight with one another, but the movie twist ending is far more captivating than the violence that at the end you are more glad with the way the movie is taking form than you are worried with the intense fight scenes.www.lagsreviews.com\n",

            "I don't think this film will work on DVD, that media is only dual layered, this film is multi layered! How I didn't get lost during this I don't know, but I was shot along with the storyline, not only understanding it, but also identifying with it. It's brilliant.I found the first half of the film almost meandered along, stretching things out to meet the latter half where the story spins around and doubles up on the speed. The ending is superb and very bizarre, in fact the whole second half is bizarre, and yet believeable.That's something that amazed me, how we were shown to understand and identify with these characters, even though they are leading and participating in some of the strangest acts. Very often we watch characters who we don't, and can't, believe in. It doesn't ruin the film, but it can't drag it down as we loose storyline and interest. That never happens here.The acting is superb, Norton and Carter steal the entire film with a surprise performance from Meat Loaf. Brad Pitt is there, and he was good, but powerfully overshadowed by Norton. The film was visually stunning and in no way was the fighting glamourised or made to look appealing, in fact those scenes were sometimes quite disturbing, the way violence really is.I've seen reviews and heard people say that it looses itself in the second half, I'd say it doesn't find itself until the second half. I think that's when we find ourselves too. You can identify, understand and sympathise with almost all that's going on, and these are keys that all film makers try and get hold of. Fincher does, and he puts them in the right lock, turns it, and opens a door that leads onto some very horrible thoughts and ideas.See this film. Now.\n",

            "Is it violent?  Yep, and I could have done without that part.  And I can very well see why in these Columbine days, why they held off on releasing the movie.  However, they get in touch with their inner selves with fisticuffs, not machine guns.  The points could have been just as well 'hammered home' without all the blood and gore.However, \"the Fight Club\" is also funny and BEST of all, it has some great comments on the huge debasement of life that is the corporate existence as we know it.  \"Work at a job you hate to make money to buy stuff you don't need,\"  was aptly said, as are many of the other great lines in this movie.Brad Pitt is sex itself in this one, showing off those great biceps and giving us all those wonderfully sardonic glances, along with his throwaway lines.  There's a great hook in here, which I won't spoil for you.  The woman is also funny and dark.  Was I cheering when the buildings holding all our credit card records went down?  You bet?  \"Destroy all the records and we start from Ground Zero\".but, just as the telephone was invented concurrently cause the time was right, so the satire in these two movies.  It was not accidental that the movement to 'free' the American man turns into the same kind of Army brain-washing and debasement that the military produces.  Robot-like, the guys become just another version of the corporate drone.  Like many revolutions, this one turns ALMOST full circle.But just one logic check here: Can you actually shoot yourself in the mouth, walk around, talk to people and still stand up?    But why should I question this when these \"let stuff happen\" devotees carefully buckle themselves up as they speed down the Interstate with no one touching the wheel. Funny!!!!\n",

            "Fight Club is one of those films that will not leave your thoughts hours and maybe even days after you've watched it. The feeling that you get after watching this movie is similar to being punched repeatedly and relentlessly for its entire 140 minutes length. David Fincher masterfully managed to create a perfect balance which makes this film an immensely visceral as well as a deeply intellectual watch.The main theme of Fight Club is freedom, or the lack of it. The script which is based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk leaves no stone unturned and adopts an unapologetic approach to convey its message about how people in society are living trapped, compromised and unfulfilling lives and following the customs and norms which are generally considered \"normal\". The common human being is just a pathetic consumer with no identity and no personality. He is just satisfied with his material possessions and has no hesitations in allowing himself to be judged and trapped by society. The unnamed main character played by Edward Norton is one such character. He is a very average citizen with nothing to look forward to in his life. He has a boring job, no prospects and he is an insomniac. His strategy to temporarily escape the mundane nature of his life is attending self help groups in the evening. But suddenly one day, he meets a suave, sharp and stylish man named Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt) and his life changes completely. I think keeping Norton's character unnamed was brilliant as it shows that he is so average, his name becomes irrelevant and he can be any one of us.The script and the original novel have to be credited immensely, but not as much as David Fincher. This film is a masterpiece because of Fincher's direction and storytelling style. He has put his stamp on this film from start to end and it is impossible to not feel the presence of the director. It is extremely fast paced. If a 140 minutes long film never makes you feel bored for even a single second, then the director deserves a bow. The film is very stylish with its visuals and Fincher uses a lot of creativity with the cinematography. The whole movie looks intentionally dirty and dark. The film is also an example of tour de force editing.Now let's come to the acting. Norton is fantastic. He expertly portrays a man who is an insomniac and who is slowly collapsing mentally due to what he considers society's pressure. Helena Bonham Carter as the infamous Marla Singer is also breathtakingly good. She is wacky,funny and just plain weird. But if there is any actor that this film belongs to,it is certainly Brad Pitt. Charisma just oozes out of every inch of Tyler Durden's body. I can't think of Tyler Durden without visualising Brad Pitt wearing that red jacket with sunglasses. Durden's philosophy,though controversial, is undeniably thought provoking.When Fight Club first came out, it was negatively accepted by some critics who opined that a film as bloody and as violent as this, might attract copycat behaviour as the film also shows how people can be manipulated and influenced. While I completely understand that opinion, but I believe that cannot reduce the quality of the film itself.Fight Club is a must watch for every film lover and it is certainly one of David Fincher's best films as well as one of the very best films of the 90s.\n",

Simply put, it's flawless. From the way it's adapted through the writing, to the way it's shot, Fincher's choice of music, editing, and of course performances. It's pacing should be studied in every film school and it's style is simply organic and original. The character development is uncanny and it's subliminal yet outward messages of a primal world is like heroin for the soul searching self-help enthusiast. I can go on and on, I actually love that this film is so often overlooked and has since been deemed a contributor to \"toxic masculinity\" because it removes the wannabes and hypebeasts.

            "FIGHT CLUB IS THE GREATEST FILM OF 1999! But wait, let me start at the beginning. Contrary to popular belief, FIGHT CLUB is not a \"depraved film about a bunch of guys who beat each other up, which will turn all men into Space Monkeys.\" It is the deepest, most intelligent and stylish film for ages.We start in the Narrator's (Edward Norton) brain and we stay there for the rest of the film. We go out of his brain, through his nostril's and down the barrel of a gun in a beginning sequence to rival Se7en's. Then we see that Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is holding the gun. Then we swoop down the building and into a van, where there are explosives which are going to be used to destroy all the major credit card company's buildings. \"I know this,\" tells the Narrator, \"because Tyler knows this.\" You won't know what any of this means until the final credits.We go back a little, to the days of the Narrator's insomnia, which is only cured by going to cancer support groups. Everything is fine for the Narrator until a woman named Marla Singer (Helen Bonham Carter) starts 'visiting' the support groups too. They work out squedules and Narrator can sleep again. Then he meets Tyler Durden on a plane and it all hits the fan.They start up a Fight Club for all of those who are like the Narrator, which soon leads to terrorist attacks on consumerism. Oh yeah, there's also a killer twist thrown in for good measure.What makes Fight Club the best film for ages is that the script itself is superb, and the direction by David Fincher is his most darkest and stylish yet. The lighting is lowkey, there is some Matrixy camerawork, there are subliminal messages (which are pointed out on the DVD commentry) and Fincher sometimes wobbles the fabric of the film itself.All in all, a first class package, superb performances, direction, oh, and let's not forget the perfect music from the Dust Brothers. A first class film, and a wake-up call for the Generation Xers. \"You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake, you are the same decaying organic matter as everything else! We are all members of the same compost heap!\"\n",

            "Fight Club tells the story of a boring man with a dull life who meets an eccentric soap salesman named Tyler Durden. The two become friends, and end up starting a \"fight club\". A place where men can vent their anger by beating the crap out of each other. As the movie moves on, the fight club gets larger until it evolves into a terrorist organization, and a shocking twist ending reveals that Tyler Durden is more than he appears. Fight Club is a very interesting film. It's a film I recommend seeing more than once to take it all in. I recall not liking it at first, but when I saw it again, I took it for what it was. A brutally violent and in your face drama/comedy that deals with many of life's problems.The always amazing Edward Norton plays the nameless lead role in the film with Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden. They both play their vastly different roles well, and the relationship between them is more believable than most movies about two friends. The writing and the build up to the ending are crafted so well that you almost get drawn right into the film. Fight Club is a dark and disturbing film that requires a thinker to view it properly. Very good.8/10\n",

            "It is always said, that the 90s were \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Trainspotting\",but in my opinion \"Fight Club\" is the most important film of the last decade (nevertheless, the two others are brilliant movies,too!). \"Fight Club\" shows in a forceful way, how life becomes existence and existence becomes meaningless, because of the total lost of the own identity. We praise television and advertising, money is our god, but we become more and more faceless beings. In the case of the narrator (Edward Norton) it leads to a split personality, schizophrenia, and the result of that is Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). A charismatic and dangerous anarchist. Together (although they are one and the same person!) they establish the fight club. And in this unity all these shattered existences get what them makes feel that they are real: Pain! It´s the best therapy that they can´t get anywhere else. After a while, Tyler plans the total overrun of society. And the narrator finds himself trapped in the net of his own conspiracy... What can I say more about this movie: David Fincher´s direction is excellent (although the film has got some length, but who really cares?!?), the score of the \"Dust Brothers\" is also great, camera handling and atmosphere are a fabulous mixture between video clip and film noir. Brad Pitt, who is still too underrated as an actor, is the stated star in this movie, but Edward Norton´s performance had deserved an oscar! (10/10)\n",

Unsettling, graphic, violent like no else, made in typical Fincher-style: dark, gritty, dirty and a bucketful of sweat. Excellent performances by Pitt and Norton (the IKEA touch is a bonus for us Swedes), great lines (\"Run, Forrest, run!\" is my favorite) and some really, REALLY wicked jokes. I recommend this film to anyone, except that you have to bear watching people slug it out some - and even beating each others' faces to bloody pulp. But the violence is not the point of this film, and if you can stand it, there are quite a few interesting issues that are brought to attention. And what more can one ask for?\n",

            "This is beyond my ability to articulate since it is beyond my experience, but not beyond my ability to appreciate.Men are alienated. They need a purpose. In our growing technological society man's role is being diminished. He no longer is central to survival. ATM's, Computers, and even the internet has co-opted their sense of place. All is meaningless in this age convenience. Men have grown soft living off the fat of the land (pun intended).I usually comment separately about the different elements of the movie. But this time I won't because I would have to mention everything and I don't have the energy to list all the features of a movie. Indeed this movie is perfect in every aspect. 10+/10-ZafoidPS: now for the truth. Why is it, according to this movie, that men have to feel a sense of place and purpose? I choose to turn it around and say that the men who feel this way are those who only get a sense of purpose from working with their hands or tools or ... weapons. In this movie their hands are their weapons and thus their purpose - indeed *Fight Club*.So it is clear then that these men are dinosaurs and they are dying out. In reality this movie (and the book as well), is their death knell. Their last \"hurrah\" to say \"we won the day\" \"we conquered the enemy\" (the enemy in this case is the technology which has displaced them - has co-opted their sense of purpose. Albeit their sense of purpose - that of conquest - is indeed misplaced outdated and no longer meaningful in a fully civilized and technological society. Indeed, we can thank God that we don't have to fear every breathing moment. Is this what they want? Yes. And so they are lost. But lost because of their misplaced projection of what life is about. It is not about conquest - it is about progress. Contributing with your mind and your heart your science and your art your time and your understanding. But these men can have none of that because they are trapped in their veltanschaung of \"survival of the fittest\". So be it, but progress has been going on since the dawn of man and it will not reverse. We have come from the age of sticks to the age of jets and we ain't going' back!) So let's give them a last \"hurrah\" for they were once important they were once the center of the world they were once the makers of history - the makers of wars ... and nations. Bid them \"farewell\" (\"Fare thee well, good knight.\") and once and for all recognize their last outcry - the last outcry of the last warrior.-Z\n",

            "I thought I knew the premise of this film: men forming anunderground fight club to get back to the basics of raw, visceral`manhood\" in our regulated, civilized society. Well, it was aboutthat, plus much more. In what is actually a deeply satirical andsurreal tale, Edward Norton plays a young put-upon corporateoffice hack into our modern consumer culture but vaguely unhappywith his life and attending a multitude of support groups, eventhough he doesn't share the other members' situations, until hemeets an offbeat soap seller (Brad Pitt) on a train and theyaccidentally exchange suitcases. The two end up living with eachother and in a rather bizarre manner, which just gets stranger as itgoes, fight each other for stimulation and form a fight club which issoon joined by many willing others. Adding to the intrigue is theinterest of Norton and Pitt in another offbeat character Marla, wellplayed by Helena Bonham Carter. Also notable is Meat Loaf'scharacter Robert Paulson, a big man who developed femininebreasts after a bout with testicular cancer. The film is certainly notjust about the fighting, which doesn't even begin until a half hourinto the movie, although there is plenty of vicious raw flesh andblood grappling and crunching to satisfy all but the most sadisticfan. Rather the story develops into even more surrealistic twists toseveral surprises at the end much of which I could not predict. Thestory is so unique, even if the theme is not, that you can easilyforgive the reality lapses. I'm giving it a 9 out of 10.\n",

For the first time in my life, however, I was motivated actually to get up and to leave the theatre in the middle of the film. Yes, the movie has a message beyond \"fighting is good\", but it is just so in-your-face that I couldn't take any more after the first hour. It did not help that I didn't care what happened to any of the characters, even though I don't have a problem with Brad, Edward, or Helena generally. Anyone who saw this movie and came away wondering exactly what the director was trying to say must have been asleep. I don't think that a film has to be completely offensive to make a point. Of course this is only my opinion! I know there is supposedly a plot twist at the end, and whatever it was, it just could not have been worth another hour and a half of this film to get to it.By the way I have seen other \"offensive\" movies and enjoyed them, Natural Born Killers being one of them, so I am not just being a weenie about the whole thing. I liked Se7en, and I completely loved The Game, but this one just is not up to their standards. See one of these movies instead if you have never seen a Fincher film before.\n",

            "Based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club explores the darker side of mental instability in the form of a dark comedy. The film tells the rather unsettling story of an insomnia stricken man, played by Edward Norton. His life changed one day when he meets a mysterious soap maker named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and, after his apartment room is blown up along with all of his belongings and the little that remains of his personal life, they became inspired to co-create a seedy underground club in which men are invited to attend and to pummel on each other to their heart's content as a form of physical therapy as well as an advanced form of personal male-bonding. Things get complex when a female drifter named Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) who inadvertently gets involved in the mentally deteriorated world that these two men share. Things only get worse when Tyler decides to take the club out onto the streets and then into their homes and into the lives of more political and respected people.As technically talented as Fincher is, what I admire most about the film is how he doesn't let the visuals tell the story. The sarcastic, bitter, angry narration of Edward Norton that plays over the events helps a lot in driving the atmosphere of the film into it's audience, but it also adds to the humor of the film. Is the film a satire? Yes. Then why the sly, cool tone, the clever dialogue, and the slick visuals? Well, to me it all seemed very forced and over-the-top. Nobody in the real world talks like these characters, and it seems pretty obvious that the film is self-aware. You can tell in the sarcastic narration. I think that people may likely forget that we're watching the story unfold from the perspective of someone who is obviously crazy. Every person in this film is crazy in one way or another. What makes the film so bizarre is the fact the thoughts of the main character make sense in the sense that they have rationale to them. The physical appearance of the main character slowly grows worse and worse while the characters around him grow more positive, more open-minded, and more like he was at the start. What makes this so funny is the fact that the methods these characters use to make themselves happier are so completely irrational and ridiculous. Not to ruin the plot, but when it comes to illegal acts of vandalism involving public property being destroyed, there comes a point where politics don't seem so important in retrospect since we live in such an interesting and advanced time in the world today.Looking at this film ten years later, it still has just as much power as it did in 1999 or 2000 or whenever it was when people decided to start watching it. As I said before, David Fincher is a technical talent. His films often hold an incredible amount of visual energy, and Fight Club is no different. The performances are excellent. Edward Norton's performance here is one of his best, as is Helena Bonham Carter. As for Brad Pitt, he does exactly what the role requires from him and kudos to his for being such a good sport for being in this film. The music in this film works equally as well. It's very dirty, industrial, and overbearing, much like the film itself. The film just has a tremendous spirit, though I can't say that I actually enjoy watching it. It's full of blood and guts from beginning to end, it's often very ugly to look at, and the film feels a little too dirty in that way that makes you want to shower. This is also a very very homo-erotic film, not just in the fight scenes but also in the way the male characters act around and toward each other. I can't say that I'm anywhere near as infatuated with it as I was when I was in high school, where any film that tried new things seemed revolutionary and brilliant, and just as well, this film makes it very difficult to take Brad Pitt seriously in most of his other films. The fight scenes in this film are also excellently choreographed and the gore effects in these scenes are wonderfully done. The final shot of the film may, at once, be considered by some to be an amazing and rebellious shot, but I laugh just thinking about it due to another very brief image in one frame of the shot that occurs just as the credits are appearing.So overall, Fight Club is still an entertaining film. It's funny, it's dark, and it provides a very honest depiction of mental illness that very few films have the balls to explore. The film has developed a strange cult following, reminiscent of the cult audience surrounding American Psycho. These people seem to feel that these two films contain deep philosophical messages about the nature of humanity, but they definitely don't. I don't think the characters in Fight Club should be taken completely seriously and I'm astounded that anyone even could take them seriously. It's like saying that Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon was right to rob the bank and that the police were all wrong. Both sides made mistakes and both sides learned things, but that doesn't change the finale of the film. If you're going to watch Fight Club, please don't try to watch it with an open-mind about the characters and the things that they say. Watch it knowing everything that you know now about politics, science, religion, and humanity. I'm sure that the film will have the desired effect on you.\n",

            "based on the novel by chuck palahniuk fight club explores the darker side of mental instability in the form of a dark comedy the film tells the rather unsettling story of an insomnia stricken man played by edward norton his life changed one day when he meets a mysterious soap maker named tyler durden brad pitt and after his apartment room is blown up along with all of his belongings and the little that remains of his personal life they became inspired to cocreate a seedy underground club in which men are invited to attend and to pummel on each other to their hearts content as a form of physical therapy as well as an advanced form of personal malebonding things get complex when a female drifter named marla helena bonham carter who inadvertently gets involved in the mentally deteriorated world that these two men share things only get worse when tyler decides to take the club out onto the streets and then into their homes and into the lives of more political and respected peopleas technically talented as fincher is what i admire most about the film is how he doesnt let the visuals tell the story the sarcastic bitter angry narration of edward norton that plays over the events helps a lot in driving the atmosphere of the film into its audience but it also adds to the humor of the film is the film a satire yes then why the sly cool tone the clever dialogue and the slick visuals well to me it all seemed very forced and overthetop nobody in the real world talks like these characters and it seems pretty obvious that the film is selfaware you can tell in the sarcastic narration i think that people may likely forget that were watching the story unfold from the perspective of someone who is obviously crazy every person in this film is crazy in one way or another what makes the film so bizarre is the fact the thoughts of the main character make sense in the sense that they have rationale to them the physical appearance of the main character slowly grows worse and worse while the characters around him grow more positive more openminded and more like he was at the start what makes this so funny is the fact that the methods these characters use to make themselves happier are so completely irrational and ridiculous not to ruin the plot but when it comes to illegal acts of vandalism involving public property being destroyed there comes a point where politics dont seem so important in retrospect since we live in such an interesting and advanced time in the world todaylooking at this film ten years later it still has just as much power as it did in  or  or whenever it was when people decided to start watching it as i said before david fincher is a technical talent his films often hold an incredible amount of visual energy and fight club is no different the performances are excellent edward nortons performance here is one of his best as is helena bonham carter as for brad pitt he does exactly what the role requires from him and kudos to his for being such a good sport for being in this film the music in this film works equally as well its very dirty industrial and overbearing much like the film itself the film just has a tremendous spirit though i cant say that i actually enjoy watching it its full of blood and guts from beginning to end its often very ugly to look at and the film feels a little too dirty in that way that makes you want to shower this is also a very very homoerotic film not just in the fight scenes but also in the way the male characters act around and toward each other i cant say that im anywhere near as infatuated with it as i was when i was in high school where any film that tried new things seemed revolutionary and brilliant and just as well this film makes it very difficult to take brad pitt seriously in most of his other films the fight scenes in this film are also excellently choreographed and the gore effects in these scenes are wonderfully done the final shot of the film may at once be considered by some to be an amazing and rebellious shot but i laugh just thinking about it due to another very brief image in one frame of the shot that occurs just as the credits are appearingso overall fight club is still an entertaining film its funny its dark and it provides a very honest depiction of mental illness that very few films have the balls to explore the film has developed a strange cult following reminiscent of the cult audience surrounding american psycho these people seem to feel that these two films contain deep philosophical messages about the nature of humanity but they definitely dont i dont think the characters in fight club should be taken completely seriously and im astounded that anyone even could take them seriously its like saying that sonny in dog day afternoon was right to rob the bank and that the police were all wrong both sides made mistakes and both sides learned things but that doesnt change the finale of the film if youre going to watch fight club please dont try to watch it with an openmind about the characters and the things that they say watch it knowing everything that you know now about politics science religion and humanity im sure that the film will have the desired effect on you\n",

            "The first rule of fight club is you don't talk about fightclub so I won....Oh,shut up. Well, we've all seen it (more than once too) and most of us loved it so what's left to say? Well, I want to praise you like I should, as the song goes. This is a film I shouldn't have liked as it's yet another cartoon from America and I tried hard not to. Glip? Trite ? Meritricious?....but to no avail, I'm doomed to love this genuinely gobsmacking picture. The one fault it has is it's ten minutes too long. You think: \"Guys, I love you, but you're exhausting me so let's rap it up\", which they do with such a spine tingling, poignant and phenomenal ending that you forgive it even that flaw. The song over the end titles was so hot I stayed right to the end. It's rare you leave an American film thinking it's the best film ever made and the most fun you've ever had in a theatre. Many couldn't accept the plot twist and I think this is because they loved the character in question so much. The radical and brave departure was right though. It made for a funnier and more truthful film as most men aren't supercool like that. Others have complained that the film doesn't take a clear stand and leaves you to have to make up your own mind. Surely this is it's virtue and what makes it so unusual? Is it profound or just a comedy about a man who goes mad? Is the ending optimistic or does it say that trying to change your life or society is futile or unattainable due to man's inherent flaws and vanities? Script, direction and performances are masterly and will set the bench mark for others to beat for years to come, not that film making is a race. There are so many great lines and observations that it's almost four films in one. The scene where Durden speculates that god may, in fact, hate you is a whole theme for a film in itself. There are some nice in-jokes. I presume the narrator wanted to fight William Shatner because of that Star Trek episode 'Shore Leave' where Kirk has an outrageously long and violent punch up with a man called Finnegan who is not real. It all ties in. The film's ending may go along more conventional lines with a ticking bomb but I suspect this is just to send up guy movies whereby someone has to always decide which wire to pull. And this is the ultimate guy pic. Another reviewer below made the astute observation that the film is really quite humane and the humour is never sarcastic but has a more Zen like reflectiveness. That's on the money. Whether you like the film will depend on your sense of humour which varies from person to person. It pokes fun at men and our need to follow others as well as other foibles. It is also ambivalent and unjudgemental about our need for aggression and excitement. I remember about three years I thought about asking my sister's commanlaw husband to have a punch up with me just for fun. I don't know why, but it proves the film is on to something. At the end of the day this film may just be rock and roll, a fun picture not to be taken too seriously. I think it was Tarkovsky who said that lots of editing and trying to entertain an audience visually was inimicable to great art. This film pulls off the trick of both leading you on and also being very wide open. It may fall into the trap of trying to make the lead character more sympathetic to the audience by making him appear ignorant of his own mayhem, and empathy is good box office, but as I said before you really have to clutch at straws to criticise this stunning and outrageous picture. The studio who financed it took a risk in making a film with content you'd expect to see in an indi feature, so reward their faith by going to see this picture or there won't be another for a long time.\n",

            "A guy is having mental issues, he does not like his job, he does not have any friends or a family, he is unhappy, he cannot sleep... A doctor advises him to join a therapy session of people with cancer - people who will die soon. \"Go there and see the real pain\". This looks like a sentence of a \"The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari-type\" philosopher, not a sentence of a medical doctor. Our unnamed guy goes there, sees much more unhappy people than him and he likes to be there - just like Marla Singer. Marla is there just because she does not have anything fun to do. She does not have a disease. She is another completely lost character. So, we have two anti-heros in the lead roles, and that makes this film \"unique\". The movie symbolizes the beginning of a new era. We had always seen a \"hero\" and an \"anti-hero\" before, in all Hollywood productions, including Fincher's previous movies. Edward Norton never stops narrating and he always sounds in the same tone, you don't hear a single emotional change. On a plane, he meets \"Tyler Durden\", who shows him \"another way to solve his problems\". After a bar visit, they fight and they both like that. They build up a \"fight club\", many anti-heros join them. Then they begin to go beyond borders, not killing people but destroying some \"capitalist buildings\" who they think as \"devils\". Kicking each other, breaking noses and bones, blowing up banks, making stupid prunks to foreign people will not/cannot bring peace to this world. The movie really glorifies violence and sado-masochism. Marla Singer, the main female character in the movie, is written as a sex object of this male-macho world, unfortunately. If you are watching \"Fight Club\" as the first time in 2022, you will see that Tyler Durden character is very predictable, because there are lots of alter-ego movies made in 2000s. Tyler is the alter-ego of our unnamed guy. He is the one who easily does things which our unnamed guy can't dare to do. That's actually scientific. Every person under heavy pressure/unhappiness, can easily develop a secondary personality to make himself feel better, creating \"virtual revanchists\" or \"a virtual happy world\" inside him. Science of psychology says that. Because for a movie,using a scientific fact is not enough for success. Tyler steals body fats of women, makes soaps, and then sell them to women and he is another \"The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari-type\" philosopher loaded with violence. \"Forget everything\", \"Get rid of property\", \"Open the gas, blow up your house, let it go\"... Could those really be the real solutions of people's unhappiness? I don't think so. We all need things, cars, houses, \"property\". I don't think the movie really criticised \"capitalist figures\" whose names are mentioned in the movie. I think the movie just advertised them. Advertising is advertising, there is not a bad advertising. Another non-convincing part was that The Club has many members in the police department. Tyler is not arrested even though he explained everything in detail to the police. The Club members just dress up like waiters, they kick the prosecutor a few times in the toilet and then the case is closed. That is like a fairy-tale with anarcho-violence added. The final sequence is the death of Tyler, rise of \"the real\" guy. He shot himself in the head but he does not die, his alter-ego dies. Really? Then blow up the banks, hug with Marla, let the happy ending come. The movie is one of the most overrated films in the history. I haven't read the book, but I know the message of the book. The writer, Chuck Palahniuk says \"It offers people the idea that they can create their own lives outside the existing blueprint for happiness offered by society\". There is no reason to agree with this, because \"their own lives\" is nothing beyond a macho-male-violence world with some cheap freedom speeches.\n",

            "I thought a lot about this movie.  I enjoyed it.  Plot twists were done well and the acting was good.  Helena Bonham Carter has succeeded in debasing her smoldering good looks sufficiently enough to become unappealing.  Maybe she believes depth to be gleaned from heroin chic.  Brad Pitt's ego was cleverly used as a plot device.  The premise of the movie of men finding some meaning to life in fighting has some appeal.  Here I sit, screwing off at work, because of the debasement I feel from the layers of management above me. The feeling of being controlled by people I have little respect for and like less for the paycheck so I can pay the mortgage and the credit card bills. I want to punch some faces in but I'm restrained by social mores.  I want to rebel against the suits but need the money.  So I passively resist convention.  I'm contrary.  The men in the movie found their outlet in fighting then by allowing themselves to be debased into obeying automatons. How ironic.  The answer to our self hatred at being social parasites is not debasement.  That seems to be self hatred.  Taking punishment as penance for our weakness.  Maybe the answer lies in having integrity.  That is what the movie lacked.  That is what is so hard to maintain in our society.   That I feel is the answer more than blowing up things because someone told you to. But it doesn't sell tickets.  A movie that sparks introspection is worth watching.  This movie, though it finally sold out, is worth watching.\n",

            "i thought a lot about this movie  i enjoyed it  plot twists were done well and the acting was good  helena bonham carter has succeeded in debasing her smoldering good looks sufficiently enough to become unappealing  maybe she believes depth to be gleaned from heroin chic  brad pitts ego was cleverly used as a plot device  the premise of the movie of men finding some meaning to life in fighting has some appeal  here i sit screwing off at work because of the debasement i feel from the layers of management above me the feeling of being controlled by people i have little respect for and like less for the paycheck so i can pay the mortgage and the credit card bills i want to punch some faces in but im restrained by social mores  i want to rebel against the suits but need the money  so i passively resist convention  im contrary  the men in the movie found their outlet in fighting then by allowing themselves to be debased into obeying automatons how ironic  the answer to our self hatred at being social parasites is not debasement  that seems to be self hatred  taking punishment as penance for our weakness  maybe the answer lies in having integrity  that is what the movie lacked  that is what is so hard to maintain in our society   that i feel is the answer more than blowing up things because someone told you to but it doesnt sell tickets  a movie that sparks introspection is worth watching  this movie though it finally sold out is worth watching\n",

            "1ST PARAGRAPH CONTAINS NO SPOILERS. This has all the hallmarks of a great movie, a very fluid sense of direction, cool cinematography, cool one-liners, and a fresh and innovative storyline. Slowly you start to notice gaps in the plot, which you accept because with a movie like this you know to expect a twist later on. As the movie progresses into anarchy you become increasingly more desperate to work out what the 'twist' is as the plot becomes more elaborate and nagging discrepancies are brought to the fore. You'll have a long wait cos its only revealed at the end of the movie and when you get there its like \"WWHHHHAAAAAATT???\", (pause for a few seconds as it filters in), \"hmmmmm, maybe i wasn't paying proper attention, no problem i'll have another watch in a few days\". With the 'knowledge' now sitting in your cerebral cortex you follow the story fully armed and only now you fully appreciate how big a cock-up the writer made.SPOILERS FROM HEREONFor those that have seen this movie, if you do not agree, i think i only need to point to one scene. If you saw a guy in your local park or even a car park (as in the infamous scene where fight club is officially born) having a psychotic episode and trying really hard to hurt himself in an at first comical, but as the moments pass more disturbing, fashion (interlude: Have you realised how hard it is to use physical attacks on yourself? It is a physical impossibility for most of us to kick ourselves, apart from kicking the other leg, or punch anything but the head with force). Anyway back to psycho dude. So you see him and its about midnight; what do you do?1. If your a good Samaritan you call an ambulance (and the mental health people).2. If your a normal person you try your best to avoid him by keeping a distance of at least 20 yards at all times.3. If your unhinged you help him accomplish his ever so difficult task of hurting himself.What you do not do is say, \"Hey dude, you're a great fighter. Wanna start up a fight club where we can all share our passion for self-mutilation on a weekly basis. You do? Great, we might also wanna erase the national credit history database without letting people know how we actually accomplished it by taking down a skyscraper.\" I know not to take this movie seriously but the fact that the writer having come up with a good plot twist, using that as the be all and end all of the movie, couldn't be bothered to finish the job and tie up all the loose ends that actually make up the story really drives me up the wall.I'd appreciate it if anybody can confirm I'm not alone on this.\n",

            "I just loved the booklet on the old DVD, where they had a collection of reviews who hated everything about Fight Club. And on the Blu-ray, they celebrated the 15th anniversary with Pitt and Norton reading out loud negative reviews. It's kind of in spirit with the movie. Finscher, Pitt, Norton and Helena Bonham-Carter knew this one would cause calamity in Hollywood. For the simpleminded, it glorifies violence. But it doesnt. If anyone take pleasure in Finscher's envelopepushing and very violent fight scenes, they have some real issues. It's ment to make you very uncomfortable, including the industrial rock, making it plain dirty. I'm not judging people who don't like Fight Club (my wife don't). It's a very different animal, cleverly executed, with Pitt's OTT cool Tyler Durden, who seems to know every philosophical quote there is to justify his very anarchetic nature. I wouldnt be surprised if Heath Ledger got inspiration to his Joker, cause there really isnt much splitting these characters apart. I feel both Ed Norton and Bonham-Carter gets to little credit for they're awesome performance. Specially the latter, who is so dirty, some of her lines were altered when Fight Club went on tv. It's a mind bending experience, which forever will offend, and fascinate. If there's anything I will critique, is the way they start they're anarchy army, which did not feel realistic. And I, for one, have absolutely NO interest to pick a fight with someone to get my nose broken. But hey, men are some strange animals. Btw, kudos for playing one of my favorite songs, Pixies \"Where is my Mind\". Pitch perfect for the end.\n",

It also has a little of art in here, once the actors talk directly to us while the movies goes on.The first minutes are a bit of confusing and they are not so attractive. However, after we get in the mood of this masterpiece, we enjoy what we see, but not the way great director David Fincher wanted us to. I conclude this due to the great surprise we discover in the end... and what a surprise!Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, two of everybody's favourite actors are very well in this film.

            "Fight Club is a fantastic movie in almost every sense. Aesthetically speaking, it is probably the most imaginative Fincher film. What's really impressive though, is the way that Fincher managed to broaden the appeal of the story, without compromising Palahniuk's message. The book is certainly entertaining as hell, but the reader is always councious of the way the book attempts to indoctrinate you (in the same vein as Atlas Shrugged). This is due in large part to Palahniuk's narrator being closer in character to Tyler Durden than Fincher's narrator is. By balancing the characters in the film, Fincher keeps the dynamic interesting, and avoids descending into a preachy tone. This accomplishes the almost unheard of on screen feat of actually improving upon a book.Indeed, judging by Palahniuk's work after fight club, it seems he too prefers Fincher's permutation. Bravo!\n",

            "Fight Club is an extraordinary movie that will take your breath away. Along with Seven (1995) this is director David Fincher's finest work, highly stylised, totally engaging and plenty of moments to catch you off guard.Going into Fight Club I wasn't sure what to expect but I was ready to be confronted by it's violence and provocations. However it was so much more than I thought it would be, notably the dark humour, the off kilter storytelling and that plot twist. It was a lot less straight forward than I bargained for as we find ourselves being sucked into Fincher's nightmarish rollercoaster world of violence, depravity and surrealism.Thanks to excellent work from Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter you get drawn in as they play around with your sensibilities onscreen. Author Chuck Palahniuk considers the film adaptation to be an improvement on his novel and Jim Uhls does an excellent job on the screenplay.The film is challenging, controversial and visceral and attempts to say something about society, materialism and existentialism. You get a sense with this material that if David Fincher hadn't made this movie then David Cronenberg definitely would have because at times it reminded me of Crash (1996) in it's examination of masculinity, perversity and nihilism. In both films the central characters are willing to literally risk life and limb to discover truth and meaning in their lives.\n",

            "*Fight SPOILERS... You know the rules*The Narrator (Edward Norton) is living a life that is as anonymous as it is unfulfilling; he is so disgusted by this that he begins to lose sleep, and decides to attend support groups for any kind of terminal illness (despite him not having any), one of them being the 'Being Men Together' group (Testicular Cancer... ouch!), where he 'befriends' Robert 'Big Bob' Paulson (Meatloaf Aday), a former bodybuilder who's developed man-tits, and this seems to cure his insomnia.That is, until the day Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a poser like him, arrives into his therapy groups and worsen his condition, since he develops a hathred for her.Then he meets a guy named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a subversive who inserts porno fragments in family movies and stuff like that, who shows him a way of channeling his negative feelings: fighting.The 'Fight Club' idea is born, and finds many adepts, but soon it gets out of hand... and The Narrator will find out the truth that lies at the very base of Tyler Durden...Based on the intense book by Chuck Palahniuk, 'Fight Club' is a movie that manages to speak truths to both sexes, while having a message that resonates clearly especially for men, who really are the more oppressed by this corrupt society.It isn't for everyone, but it's a film to be watched, at least once. And then, to be talked about.Fight Club: 10/10.\n",

            "Words cannot describe how much I love this movie. We will glance briefly over the fact that Brad Pitt has probably never been sexier and spends a good deal of time partially nude. Actually lets just contemplate that for a moment before moving on.Mmmmmmmm.Anyway. I find the movie as a whole intensely sexy. A perfect dark mixture of surrealism, freedom, violence and sex. I too have never been in a fight. The very concept terrifies and arouses me. I think to actually just go the f**k for it and not only take the pain but take it in an uncontrolled way and return it might do a lot of us a power of good. Grab life by the balls and kick it in the teeth. But it's so far from anything most of us are likely to do (especially women, of which I am one) that it probably would take an episode of real mental breakdown to be able to do it. Fight Club is a lot like bdsm, well really only sm. It's (the actual fight club part not the whole movie) about the emotional and social freedom inherent in inflicting and receiving pain. If you're hurt you can cry or scream, if you're angry or frustrated you can lash out. The ultimate stress release. The way pain strips you of all complexity until there is nothing else that exists but excruciating sensation.To cry not because you're depressed and life sucks or something bad has happened, assuming you even cry then, but because it hurts. It hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts. There's something very pure about that.The difference between bdsm and fight club is that, in general, bdsm is controlled and will not leave permanent marks or anything requiring hospital treatment. This is a positive and a negative. It lacks some of the freefalling savagery of fight club but in return it gains practicality. We cannot all walk around with our faces bashed in and in the end you will get seriously hurt. There are only so many times you can have your head bashed against the floor before you don't wake up. I don't particularly want my head bashed against the floor at all. I suspect I like the concept a lot more than the actuality of fight club. I am a big coward.The movie as a whole is a trip in every way. It has things to say, it's beautiful and painful to look at, the characters are interesting, the end is fitting. One of the best movies I've seen.\n",

            "Despite its name, Fight Club is no dumb, goofy martial arts flick. It's the twisted, deeply psychological tale of a corporate desk jockey whose world is turned upside down by a chance encounter. It's a movie about breaking free from your boring, conformist existence. And it's an eye opening examination of modern consumerist society- wrapped in layers of shocking violence, oddball humor, and dream scenes and hallucinations reminiscent of Dali. It's weird. It's not for children or the faint of heart. And it will blow your mind.Edward Norton's unnamed protagonist is an insomniac. For months the only way he's been able to get a good night's sleep is by going to support groups for problems he doesn't have. The emotional release he experiences with people worse off than himself allows him to loosen up, forget his troubles, and overlook the fact that he's a shameless faker. But things become even weirder when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) an anti-conformist rebel and self styled 'urban guerrilla.' Thrown together by literally explosive circumstances, the pair discovers a release from the pressures and monotony of modern life in the form of no-holds-barred, one-on-one combat.Their idea catches on, and despite the number one rule of fight club being that you don't talk about fight club; their hobby rapidly grows into a secret society of like-minded nobodies. But as Tyler's nihilism and revolutionary fervor take hold, what was once a way to blow off steam becomes something much more sinister. And reality becomes blurred with fantasy as our unnamed hero finds himself in the center of a labyrinthine conspiracy of crime and destruction- one that everyone else seems to think he's behind.An important thing to understand about this movie is that none of the major characters are entirely sane. Not Tyler Durden, who splices individual frames of porn into family movies down at the local theater and makes soap using stolen by-products from the local liposuction clinic. Not the Norton character, who freely chooses to live in a decrepit, horrifyingly unsafe old house with the man I've just described and increasingly comes to confuse hostility and not giving a damn with enlightenment. And certainly not Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) the chain-smoking, habitually lying nympho who attends all the same support groups as the protagonist for equally fraudulent reasons, regularly threatens or attempts suicide, and begins having a passionate if somewhat confusing relationship with Durden.Another important thing to understand about Fight Club is that the movie itself is insane, in the best way possible. I'm talking Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction insane. Like a Tarantino film, Fight Club is unbelievably over the top, earning its R rating in every way possible. Again and again there are parts so shocking, so wrong, that you can't help but burst out laughing, and then wonder if you're as screwed up as the people on the screen. There are parts so bizarre that for a moment you're not sure that this is still the same movie. There are numerous seeming plot holes and bits that won't make sense until the end.And then there are the inherent contradictions within the whole premise of the movie. At its core, Fight Club is about internal development and self-discovery- which are achieved by beating other people senseless in the basement of a rundown liquor joint and blowing stuff up. Our guide on this journey of enlightenment is an antisocial, borderline psychotic narcissist who takes a view of mankind similar to Thomas Hobbes and whose main concern is sticking it to the man. Plus, as previous critics and websites like Cracked.com have pointed out, his plan to take down the man and stand up for the little guy would likely result in the deaths of dozens if not hundreds of blue collar night shift workers. And don't even get me started on the dynamics of a movie that attacks consumerism and obsession with material wealth raking in hundreds of millions of dollars.But none of this is a problem in the least. Fight Club isn't meant to be realistic or make perfect sense. The sheer absurdity of the situation is half the selling point, and any inconsistencies only add to its rich texture. This is pure escapism taken to –and beyond- its logical limits. When you get right down to it, Fight Club is the ultimate 'take this job and shove it fantasy. Tyler's brand of populist anarchy is sure to have a certain appeal to anyone who's ever felt bored with their life, been dissatisfied with their job, or run up way too many credit card bills. I suppose it's a good thing that this message comes from a criminal psychopath, or else someone might take it seriously.Bottom line, there are really no words to describe how ludicrous, hilarious, action packed, and truly awesome this movie is. It may be the greatest 'guy movie' ever made. It's certainly deeper and more complex than most movies with its levels of sex, violence, and language. This is the kind of movie that will still be regularly quoted and shown at midnight screenings decades from now. Assuming that you have a high tolerance for mature content, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy. Oh, and even if you already know the ending, go ahead and see it anyway. It will still be one of the most entertaining things you've seen in a long time.\n",

assuming that you have a high tolerance for mature content do yourself a favor and pick up a copy oh and even if you already know the ending go ahead and see it anyway it will still be one of the most entertaining things youve seen in a long time\n",

            "Of all of the most popular films to come out in the past 25 years, Fight Club is one that I finally got the chance to watch. Fight Club was released in 1999 and based off of the 1996 Chuck Palahniuk novel of the same name (of which I have not read). The film was directed by David Fincher (visual effects on Star Wars: Episode VI- Return of the Jedi, visual effects on The NeverEnding Story, and appeared in Being John Malkovich) (also love doing research and coming up with weird credits like that) and stars Brad Pitt (Megamind, producer on Selma, and Inglourious Basterds), Edward Norton (American History X, Collateral Beauty, and Primal Fear), Helena Bonham Carter (Terminator: Salvation, Enola Holmes, and Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street), Meat Loaf (The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Formula 51, and Wayne's World), and Jared Leto (Blade Runner 2049, Dallas Buyers Club, and Suicide Squad). The film was not as huge of a financial success as initially anticipated and upon release, received polarizing reviews from critics but has since become one of the biggest cult films to be released in the past 25 years.The Narrator (Edward Norton) lives a life of nothing and is very unhappy with it. He goes to support groups and poses as having a sickness. But one day while on a plane, he meets a soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and together they make their own underground Fight Club were men can come and beat each other up. Eventually things take a turn........Fight Club is a film that I had zero clue about which surprises me when it comes to a film of such notoriety. I knew nothing of it other than it's reputation. What I can say is that on a technical level, Fight Club is absolutely fantastic. The camera work and editing are great and David Fincher at this point in time in 1999, has fully matured as a director. Other praises go toward the lead actors. Brad Pitt does a fantastic job in this film and as always, Edward Norton never disappoints. The film has some very heavy handed themes and subjects to a point that I nearly had no idea what the film was trying to get at. I understand we have a man, who is an insomniac and is very materialistic as seen early on when his apartment is blown up who is seeking attention and his escape is ultimately this Fight Club that ultimately glorifies violence and masculinity which then evolves into something far greater and more extreme. This film just requires a lot of attention to fully comprehend these themes and for my first time viewing it seems I have an idea and definitely requires a second viewing because there were also instances where I was unsure of what the film itself was trying to say and as someone who is largely intrigued by the film, I want to be able to have a better grasp on the subjects and I only mention this because I cannot be the only one that feels this way about this film. The film itself is much like Natural Born Killers in that both films were critically divisive upon release, both are essentially social satire, and are wild trips to get through. The film has a plot twist in it that I actually find really really good in that I was not expecting it whatsoever. A second viewing of the film will definitely be a delight and going back and seeing the really subtle clues that pop up and make the twist make sense. If I have to have anything outwardly negative is Helena Bonham Carter's character of Marla Singer. To me, while her character certainly had lots of screen time, it was unclear to me what her purpose to the film was. The film ends as wild as a film like this should end but I can't really complain especially with the end credits song being \"Where Is My Mind?\" by The Pixies.For a first time viewing, I really enjoy this film but I find it hard to put it up there in my top tier. With that being said, I was intrigued enough that I would be willing to give this film a second viewing later on down the road.\n",

            "Fight Club (1999)\"How much do you know about yourself, if you 've never been in a fight\"Tyler DurdenFight Club has been hailed by audiences and critics alike. I can see why. It's iconic, it's compelling and it is stylish. David Fincher's camera work is beautiful, he really captures some great sequences - and the editing is superb, scenes roll together in their raw, punchy nature, the film is good.As much as I can praise the style and nature of 'Fight Club', its modern 'Clockwork Orange' approach, I cannot see this film as a masterpiece. Why not? Well it doesn't have much. It's visually stimulating, it has good acting and technical aspects, but not much else.Cutting to the chase , 'Fight Club' is about an urban loner (Edward Norton) who is fed up with his boring life. On a trip he meets a soap salesman played by Brad Pitt (this man does not actually exist, it's his alter ego). After Norton's apartment is burned down, he contacts Durden (Pitt) and he moves in with him into a disgusting, run down estate. Slowly, they start the FIGHT CLUB. More and more members join across the USA and more and more attacks are carried on Blue Chip companies.As Norton spirals into paranoia, he runs away from this business of anti-social leadership, when things get strange. He realises he is Tyler Durden and finally shoots himself through the brain to kill his second personality, just in time to observe the beautifully crafted explosions of the city skyscrapers.It's engaging, but not great. It is a interesting film and leave it at that.7/10\n",

            "Fight Club is impossibly negative and depressing, but many won't care. There's a message somewhere in Fight Club but if you really get off on screen violence, well, so what.Fight Club is very well made, so well produced that it's disturbing. Everyone will enjoy it on that level. But will you send their mates along to grovel in the violence?There are some delicious moments of black humour but the overall feel of Fight Club just isn't funny. It's Falling Down grown up. It's Mortal Kombat with real mortal combat. It's an Artless Raging Bull.It's apocalyptic if you take it seriously enough. But for most of the population Fight Club will be just a good ol' parade of blood and smashed teeth.Fight Club contends that many American males these days have become so bored and ground down by paying the mortgage in an essentially meaningless society that they have become pathologically desperate.And for a moment I believed it. You'd have to! There's a call to arms at one stage, the mantra is recited in the bowels of Fight Club World. The thugs were mesmerised and so was I. There it was. Fanaticism. Madness. A boys club with sharp teeth.A visionary and bully called Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) starts forming secret clubs where men meet for vicious fights. Men flock to the Fight Clubs because they find that the pain and solidarity they find there bring meaning to their lives.Soon Durden is forming an army of disenchanted men who are willing to follow his anarchistic programs. Durdan plans to rip society apart, destroy commerce and ruin order.We're never told what Durdan envisages might come from this chaos, but you wouldn't expect much from organised thugs, would you.There is a secret but as I've said Fight Club isn't really about the philosophy of political systems or about run-amok commercialism. Fight Club is about violence and grot. It's about boys (not girls) getting their shirts off, forgetting about Mum and bashing the hell out of each other.The stars give superb performances. Edward Norton (Primal Fear, American History X) plays Narrator with the intensity and intelligence we've come to expect from him. Brad Pitt is strong in a film which seems to suit him admirably. (Perhaps that's a worry!)Helena Bonham Carter, escaped from English costume dramas for a change does a good job of slumming it as Marla Singer, although a million actresses could eat up that sort of overacting.Meat Loaf with bitch tits is just fine as the slobbing, sobbing Big Bob but I was mesmerised mostly by the slashing direction by David Fincher (Aliens 3, Seven). His use of sound in particular was superb.Fight Club is essentially what was called a few years ago an Action Movie, but a very well made action flick. Violence rules, damn the plot, particularly philosophy.There are a couple of ideas hidden by a thick smear of blood, outstanding production values and it does closely mirror Chuck Palahniuk's novel. But hell if I want to be depressed I'll watch the news.Meanwhile men pleasing themselves in their own Fight Club, kicking in heads on Shields Street on a Friday night, scream \"we are the news!\".\n",

            "Fight Club is a pitiful movie. Awful. I reviewed it twice already, but those reviews didn't make sense. I finally nailed what was the main reason I hated this movie. There are a lot of reasons why. But there are two major ones. All Fight Club is a giant, anarchy propaganda \"film\". We have laws for a reason. \"Start a fight with someone on a street\". What is that going to solve? Anything at all? Although the \"film\" doesn't glamorize violence, it does show it being used for no reason whatsoever except for a cheap laugh. Fight Club becomes the epitome of everything that is despises by the end. Sure, I agree that \"things we own end up owning us\" but what I don't agree with the actions that characters do in Fight Club. However, Fight Club would simply be an awful film it tanked, but the fact that so many people like it and agree with it is far more disturbing. These people are idiots, more harmful to society than any Adam Sandler lover you'll ever meet. These are the same 20-something punks who like anarchy, who think Bush is too conservtive. (so I can't spell) Why do moms like to go destroy little videogames that are not harmful at all? Where's the banning of this film? This film has more negative influence than any violent videogame could offer. They offer violence as a solution, and millions of people agree. What a sad day in America... Now of course, there are the \"filmic\" (err...) flaws, such as the stupid, pointless, long monologues and philosophies, and the \"hey! Look what I can do with this cool camera!\" direction, and the fact that Brad Pitt couldn't act his way out of a paper bag, and Helena Bonham Carter adds nothing to the story, how stupid and pointless the surprise at the ending is, how the film skips long periods of time, leaving us confused...I could go on.I strongly detest anyone who declares this the best film of all time. This is nothing. This is just trash. So, email me if you want with your little gen-x comments and what-not, but one day you'll realize that violence is never an answer, and rules are enforced for a reason., and then you'll realize that Fight Club and everything involved is evil! I feel like going to church now. No stars. Negative stars. Negative 10 stars. I p**s on this.\n",

            "fight club is a pitiful movie awful i reviewed it twice already but those reviews didnt make sense i finally nailed what was the main reason i hated this movie there are a lot of reasons why but there are two major ones all fight club is a giant anarchy propaganda film we have laws for a reason start a fight with someone on a street what is that going to solve anything at all although the film doesnt glamorize violence it does show it being used for no reason whatsoever except for a cheap laugh fight club becomes the epitome of everything that is despises by the end sure i agree that things we own end up owning us but what i dont agree with the actions that characters do in fight club however fight club would simply be an awful film it tanked but the fact that so many people like it and agree with it is far more disturbing these people are idiots more harmful to society than any adam sandler lover youll ever meet these are the same something punks who like anarchy who think bush is too conservtive so i cant spell why do moms like to go destroy little videogames that are not harmful at all wheres the banning of this film this film has more negative influence than any violent videogame could offer they offer violence as a solution and millions of people agree what a sad day in america now of course there are the filmic err flaws such as the stupid pointless long monologues and philosophies and the hey look what i can do with this cool camera direction and the fact that brad pitt couldnt act his way out of a paper bag and helena bonham carter adds nothing to the story how stupid and pointless the surprise at the ending is how the film skips long periods of time leaving us confusedi could go oni strongly detest anyone who declares this the best film of all time this is nothing this is just trash so email me if you want with your little genx comments and whatnot but one day youll realize that violence is never an answer and rules are enforced for a reason and then youll realize that fight club and everything involved is evil i feel like going to church now no stars negative stars negative  stars i ps on this\n",

            "A nameless narrator struggles with insomnia and the insanity of his day-to-day existence, attending support groups as a means to cope with his fragile emotional state. When he meets Marla, who herself attends support groups, life seems to become slightly better for doing so. However, when his path crosses that of Tyler Durden, he finds becoming a part of his new friend's shady fight club, as well as his even shadier soap-making business. Eventually, things begin to spiral out of control when Tyler founds Project Mayhem, and events proceed to go from bad to even worse.Based off of Chuck Palahniuk's incendiary novel, David Fincher's Fight Club had something of a polarizing reception upon its theatrical release back in 1999. It gained criticism for its violence, as well as concerns that it would encourage copycat behavior. The very same kind of criticism A Clockwork Orange received on its release back in 1971. Indeed it's safe to say that Fincher's adaptation of Palahniuk's novel was provocative as it was controversial. Making it one of the most talked about movies of the 90s. Revolving around a nameless lead protagonist played by Edward Norton, who also narrates. He finds himself sucked into the underground masculinist movement led by the charismatic anarchist Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt. Fight Club is best described as a satirical blacker-than-black comedy that sinks its teeth deep into you and never lets go of its sharp grip. After all Norton's Narrator attends support groups for problems that he doesn't have like testicular cancer or HIV. At one of which he finds comfort in the arms of Bob Paulson (Meatloaf being the excellent unsung hero of the movie).The Narrator finds himself enveloped in Tyler's machinations, which start with the Fight Club he founds where a group of men seemingly feel as aimless and lost as Norton. Each one goes mano on mano in bloody fistfights. Of course, it's not long before Tyler begins to kick things up a notch, and his true agenda becomes apparent. Fight Club soon evolves into Project Mayhem where Tyler and his army of brainwashed lackeys carry out random acts of anti-capitalist violence. Sufficce it to say, Fincher's movie is a stinging satire on consumerism, Capitalist America, and Generation Xers. The U. S. in Fincher's world has seemingly become a society of men whose existence has become rendered empty and meaningless by the materialism of contemporary society. Finding mutual self-meaning, while male-bonding by beating one another to a bloody pulp. Reading between the lines, there's most certainly a homo-erotic subtext that is assuredly purposeful on the part of Fincher. Not least of all in the relationship between the lead protagonist and his figurative master. It offers more context into the Narrator's initial aversion to Marla (who we will come to in due course), and how he is seemingly repelled by her.Fincher directs in a lurid, grimy style that compliments the movie's nihilistic tone. From its blistering opening credits sequence to its startling final shot. It's a visually arresting piece of cinematic mastery. There is after all something of an ethereal dream-like quality to the scenes where the Narrator frequents the nocturnal support groups. He however never loses sight of the absurdity deeply embedded within it. The movie's two lead characters carry out raids on liposuction clinics to use women's fat as ingredients in Soap which they sell back to them. While the movie's Narrator recounts how Tyler would splice a brief moment of pornography into a children's movie when he worked as a Cinema projectionist. It's darkly off-kilter, as it is supremely anarchic and subversive.Fincher also has the benefit of an amazing cast with Norton being simply breathtaking as the movie's apathetic anti-hero. Who seems detached from the rest of the world around him. Narrating and observing proceedings with a casual melancholic resonance. Capturing the right measure of cynicism that is required. He's sublimely contrasted and complimented by Pitt who brings equal measures of charisma, greasiness, and magnetism as the smooth-talking Tyler Durden. They're backed up with some weighty support from Helena Bonham Carter as the somewhat unbalanced Marla Singer. A woman who the Narrator finds some brief semblance of solace with, perhaps because to some degree he has found someone as lost and troubled as he is. Although she takes it to something of a disturbing all-new level. As well of course as the aforementioned Meatloaf, while Jared Leto appears in a small supporting role as one of Tyler's followers.One would be forgiven for thinking that with Fight Club, Fincher could not pull out any more surprises than what he already has, but indeed he does that with a shock reveal which will is so unexpected that it will hit you right between the eyes. It all culminates in an awe-inspiring final act where Fincher dials things up to eleven and then some, with a finale that is as crazy as it is surreal. Fight Club is as challenging and daring today as it was upon its release, it marks what has become a seminal piece of filmmaking, and one of the definitive movies of the 90s.\n",

the narrator finds some brief semblance of solace with perhaps because to some degree he has found someone as lost and troubled as he is although she takes it to something of a disturbing allnew level as well of course as the aforementioned meatloaf while jared leto appears in a small supporting role as one of tylers followersone would be forgiven for thinking that with fight club fincher could not pull out any more surprises than what he already has but indeed he does that with a shock reveal which will is so unexpected that it will hit you right between the eyes it all culminates in an

            "I believe Roger Ebert is a literate man. I also believe he lacks true intelligence. As does anyone else who dismisses this movie on grounds of excessive violence (this from the man who wrote Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, a movie in which a character is killed by forced anal sex involving a 20 inch pointed strap-on dildo, for christ's sake). People here who fail to see the brilliance of this movie, comment that the 'excessive swearing and nudity' sickened them. Since when is nudity a sickening thing? Does the word 'f**k' make you convulse in nausea? It's just the human body, we all have one. It's just a word depicting an activity that the majority of us partake in. Prudishness like that doesn't sicken me, it does infuriate me though.Excessive violence? First of all, there isn't that much violence in this movie. What little there is seems to have an unpleasant quality, though - it's realistic. When you pound a man's head into a concrete floor, it really does turn into a bloody mess. What's the problem? Is violence not a real concept? Do people actually never fight? This movie deals with violence responsibly, more responsibly than any other movie i can think of. This isn't Arnie throwing faceless bad guys through plaster walls, this is a depiction of what really happens when you beat the living shit out of people, or when someone gets a bullet in the head. It's not excessive in the slightest. It's just real.'How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?' asks Tyler Durden. How much do you know about the reality of being human if you've never left the creature comforts of your safe little worlds, if you've never run for your lives, if you've never felt adrenaline pumping into your body and your instincts taken over as your hand clenches into a fist? Ebert is a prime example of a literati, who by the looks of him has never been in a fight. I doubt he fought in Vietnam, or has ever faced violence. And that's my point - human beings aren't simply their intellect, they are also animals with instincts. What's your point, Ebert, that we must forego our urges? What if the urge is to fight, and the fighting is consensual? I know that you aren't against excess in sexual matters, due to your involvement with Russ Meyer films. Are some urges, in your opinion, more harmful? Sex is better than violence? Ask a rape victim if he or she had preferred a good beating instead.But Fight Club is not about violence. It's about survival instincts (they fight to feel alive, not to cause pain). It's about men with no great depression, no great war. Throughout human history, men have had to fight for their survival, whether in earning a living or fighting in wars. No longer. What's the point now? That's what the movie asks. I am not personally a consumer-minded individual, i consider myself more of a hedonist. I don't care about things, unless things actually let me enjoy myself more. I don't need Tyler's preaching. But a lot of people do. If a pair of CK underwear makes you feel better about yourself, then there's something seriously wrong.Someone here said that this movie's message is an insult to the world that our ancestors fought to give us. It does not insult that. It insults and questions the way we live in that world. Did soldiers storm the beaches of Normandy for Britney Spears and valley girls saying 'like, duh'? Did Churchill sacrifice Coventry for Big Brother and cell phone ringtones? Did the people Hiroshima and Nagasaki die for Pokemon?This movie is about a lot of things, it's brilliantly written, brilliantly shot, brilliantly acted, brilliantly directed. It makes you think, it makes you smile in agreement, it makes you shake your head in disapproval. That is, if you have a brain. If someone asks me what the best movie i've ever seen is, my answer would have to be Fight Club.P.S. some people have called this movie fascist...Fascism - A system of government marked by centralization of authority under a dictator, stringent socioeconomic controls, suppression of the opposition through terror and censorship, and typically a policy of belligerent nationalism and racism. ...says the dictionary. The space monkeys worship Tyler Durden in the same way Buddhists worship Buddha - he is to them an enlightened individual to whom they look for instruction. Cult of personality does not a fascist make. Tyler Durden is a clear-cut anarchist.\n",

I watched the first 20 minutes and I fell bored out of my mind but then I decided to watch it for a second time starting from the beginning and boy! This time I was thoroughly entertained by the film. Why!?!Simple, the film had great acting, a great story behind it with clever dialogue and a great mystery behind the whole story. The pacing of the film and the fact that the Narrator is held at gunpoint by Tyler and goes back to recount how he met Tyler and what happened between the two to form the Fight Club which later turned into the deadly 'Project Mayhem'. The story was all very interesting and the film ended really well.Never during the film the second time did I feel bored or just begin to hate it. The film flowed along very nicely. I in particular enjoyed the chemistry between the Narrator and Brad Pitt's Tyler Durton.This is definitely one classic that you cannot miss out on.\n",

            "So after reading many of the \"I hate\" comments I realized a thing or two, well 1st of all there a few who think this movie is in a way (even if u may not realize it) an insult to Capitalism. Well let me tell you something, \"IT IS TRUE\"Well there were people asking for the fact that why would young men join something this mindless. Well I have to say this but, \"Mindlessness is the virtue for a tortured soul\". There are many people who would do anything to get out of their present situation, for example many poor Thai people (like villagers) who take on \"Muay Thai\" (or kick boxing as many know), just as a way to get out of their present situation or life. Plus this is a movie not a documentary, there are bound to be mistakes. Get the idea behind it, if you are looking for flaws you can find it in \"Monalisa\" too.And Oscars, well Shawshank Redemption also didn't get that much noticed did it? So didn't so many great movies. \"The Departed\" I mean come on, Martin Scorsese did deserve an Oscar, but \"Departed\" was not the one he should have received it for.\"Raging Bull\",\" Goodfellas\", etc etc. He never got one for these???? Isn't that strange.I'll say no, because this is what life is \"Random Events, with no reasons most of the time\". So what if fight club didn't get noticed for Oscar. Even better its like an artist never being realized for his caliber in his times. And this is movie is for dumb people? So what makes you so sure that you are that smart?

            "\"Fight Club \" is the current climax of the work of director David Fincher (Alien 3, Seven, The Game), who is one of the best (if not THE best) directors running around in Hollywood at the moments.Like all of his movies, Fight Club is a very dark and atmospheric movie, containing lots and lots of black humour and quite explicit violence. The plot, involving people setting up clubs were they can fight just to counter boredom is original enough by itself, but it also contains several really unexpected and shocking plot twists, much like in \"The Game\", or \"the Sixth Sense\". What's even better, these twists are actually quite believable compared to many other thrillers (for example, \"Along came a spider\" contains some of the poorest plot twists ever).Is there anything wrong with Fight Club ? Frankly, no.  This is one of the only two movies (Pulp Fiction is the other one) that I have given a perfect score of 10/10. Must see !**** out of **** stars\n",

            "David Fincher's (DF) masterpiece is Fight Club (FC) (1999).DF who's one of the most innovative and considered a great filmmaker himself worked really hard on producing FC.FC is an american film from 1999 based on the 1996 novel by Chuck Palahniuk.The plot of the film is basically in summary is.......Edward Norton plays the unnamed protagonist, referred to as the narrator, who is discontented with his white-collar job. He forms a \"Fight Club\" with soap maker Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, and they are joined by men who also want to fight recreationally. The narrator becomes embroiled in a relationship with Durden and a dissolute woman, Marla Singer, played by Bonham Carter.The director and the cast compared the film to Rebel without a cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967). They said its theme was the conflict between a generation of young people and the value system of advertising.This film is a cinematic feast. As a Sri Lankan film fanatic that troubled rebellious men is a talked about factor and loved by filmmakers and fans alike.Fight Club's got some hard hitting quotes for the audiences.Tyler Durden : The things you own end up owning you.Narrator : I found freedom. Losing all hope was freedom.Tyler Durden : It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.Tyler Durden : Listen up, maggots. You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else.Narrator : This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time.Tyler Durden : You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You're not your fu*king Khakis. You're the all singing, all-dancing crap of the world.Tyler is like an annihilistic priest. His words are true but dangerous and if you blindly follow them it's chaos. And that is what you see in the film.DF's approach and style in films are basically follows.Fincher likes to map out camera movement with computer-generated imagery, commission intricate sets, gets heavily involved in post-production, and re-shoot footage after the principal photography has wrapped. He does not normally use hand-held cameras when he shoots a film, preferring cameras on a tripod, this most frequent use of a hand-held camera was for Se7en, in which five scenes were shot that way. Fincher likes to confuse audiences with his camerawork. Sometimes, it is difficult to determine whether a shot is human-controlled, motion-controlled or computer-generated imagery. Close ups are as little as possible. The interior of a refrigerator can be seen in a number of Fincher's films; this can be seen as part of character and story development.All of these are in FC.As a Sri Lankan many films like Machan (2008), Mille Soya Buongiorno Italia (2004) and Motorcycle (2016) depicts the internal and external struggles of the youth and middle aged men of Sri Lanka.And FC will be the one and only depiction of the American man's perspective in 1990's on consumerism.\n",

            "I can not understand what the fascination with this film is. All I get from this film is a bunch of guys who starts out beating each other up and then rebelling against society. And it's started by a yuppie, no less. Do they feel trapped by the conventions of society? Do they feel emasculated? If so why don't they just go to one of those caveman retreats where you dance around naked and doing primal screams, so you can connect with your ancestors and your inner caveman and spare society from your destructive urges.I have heard and read some people saying this is the greatest film they have ever seen. It makes me wonder who they identify with, is it The Narrator the guy who feels impotent by society or Tyler Durden the rebel leader who has taken a path against social convention. Personally I think both characters are among the most worthless characters I have ever seen in the Movies. Neither have any really redeeming quality. Both on the extreme side. One meek and almost helpless while the other is brash and fearless. Even when we find out the truth about the characters it really doesn't help the situation.This is a well crafted film, it looks good, crisp direction, well acted. Edward Nortons needs to be called what he is, the best actor of his generation, even better than Sean Penn in my opinion. He does a fantastic job playing the meek office drone. Even in his narration we hear a guy who seems to have little passion for his own life. Brad Pitt is very good too playing Tyler Durden. The guy is the opposite of The Narrator. He has passion but for what? to harm society? This movie has been described as subversive, a call out against societal convention. But to what? To chaos and destruction against society? Is that really much more preferable? Well like I said previously go to those caveman weekend, strip naked, yell out your primal scream and don't come back because society is better off without you.\n",

            "Let me say straight away: See this movie. It's absolutely fantastic. It's one of only a handful (and by that I mean under five) movies where, after seeing it, I just sat in my seat in the cinema for a few moments because I was so stunned: It's that good.First of all the story-line. It's obviously counter-culture but it's doing it with it's tongue firmly lodged in it's cheek (after all it's commenting on consumerism through a Hollywood movie). It's a well paced storyline. The only detraction is that the \"twist\" is sometimes unbelievable in retrospect and can make the movie seem somewhat silly at times but I can let that slide.The acting... It's got Edward Norton. He's my favourite actor. I'm left in awe of him. He's incredibly good. He is the ultimate cynic in this movie. Brad Pitt perfectly counter-points him and once again shows he is far from being a pretty boy actor. And Mrs. Carter is just great as Marla - I'll forever see her as some bizarre Bohemian freak...And now the directing. Wow. A film like \"Lord of the Rings\" is beautiful in an epic kind of way. \"Fight Club\" is creative. There's so many creative touches that add to this movie. I knew David Fincher was one to watch after the fantastic \"Se7en\". His ability to direct also showed through on \"The Game\". Here however he surpasses himself. It's a visual treat. He keeps the story moving brilliantly. A scene that could have been rendered somewhat tiresome by another director has my jaw open here. Whether it's a bizarre montage of images, an extremely quick cinematic cut or a misaligned frame Fincher employs an array of skills to make this movie one of the most memorable looking movies that I have ever seen.In conclusion I say that I can't say enough nice things about \"Fight Club\". It's one of the best movies I've ever seen (and I've seen a fair few). I recommend that if you haven't seen it that you watch it immediately. And watch it multiple times. One of the very very few movies I'd give 10/10.\n",

            "While I know this movie made a big fuss on virtually the entire movie world, I am one person whose game enough to admit that he did not like it at all. Yet half way through it I was thinking, yeah this is ok'. However by the end, I was confused and disappointed, as this film took me to places that I could never have imagined.The mundane existence of a product liability evaluator and insomniac, who is addicted to self-help groups, is turned upside down when he meets a sado-masochistic anarchist who is secretly plotting to overthrow civilisation. As their friendship grows, they become increasingly involved in a secret society of \"fight clubs\" where men act out their aggressions and violently beat one another to a pulp. In the meantime, the evaluator falls in love with a woman who is also addicted to self-help groups, but is unable to act on his desire for her.Director of Fight Club was David Fincher, who had done some really good movies, such as the Michael Douglas thriller The Game' and the murder mystery, Se7en'. Yet with Fight Club', I found myself getting more frustrated, as the movie continued on. This I believe has to be due to the direction of the movie by Fincher. I mean, what was the last 30 minutes of the movie actually about? I am still unsure, do not want to know, but will say that it did not impress me.However the movie's story did have some good elements. I enjoyed the idea of an underground boxing' club, as was the scummy setting that we see the movie placed in for the majority of the film. But the brutal, ungloved beatings were for me, pretty hard to take, as was some of the violence that went on after that, and as I have mentioned, I did not like (or understand) the end of the movie, which made the film's story seem crazy for me. The idea for the story of this movie was taken from the novel of the same name, by Chuck Palahniuk. While the screenplay for the movie was written by Jim Uhls.The movie stars a reasonably good cast. Main star, known only as Narrator (Edward Norton) was one character that I found myself in some way liking. He is an angry depressed man, whose is in a frustrating job, but life is about to have a big change. This change is due largely to him meeting up with Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Tyler helps narrator out, giving him a place to live. Yet he also gives narrator a look inside the weird and ugly world of the Fight Club'. Tyler states The first rule of Fight Club is - you do not talk about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight Club is - you DO NOT talk about Fight Club.'While I know that many people found both Norton and Pitt to be great performers, I found some of Pitt's character traits to be really disturbing, especially when he keeps inviting fellow boxers to bash him up', like the scene where he tempts and pushes Narrator to flog him pretty bad. I also feel that Durden's ideas behind the fight club are bit hard to take. Look I preferred Pitt in movies such as Thelma and Louise' and the wonderful movie Interview with the Vampire'.Narrator is also addicted to  support group meetings', going to one every night of the week. This is where narrator meets a bizarre chain-smoking woman called Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter). Her character brings in the strange sexual ideas into the movie. It is easy to understand that her character is angered by the men in this movie, who would prefer to bash each other around, then to have sex with her. In a world set in reality, that would be quite unusual. I enjoyed Helena's performance (and movie for that matter) much more, in the 2001 remake of The planet of the Apes'.I recently had a shot at well known Chicago movie critic, Roger Ebert, for his harsh words on the movie Dead Poets Society'. But while he is entitled to his opinion and I am to mine, I was trying to think of the reasons why I struggled to like Fight club', so I decided to read his opinion on this movie. I have to agree with his conclusion, which states: \"Fight Club\" is a thrill ride masquerading as philosophy--the kind of ride where some people puke and others can't wait to get on again'. I have to admit that I am part of the first group, who by the end of this film could not wait for it too finish. I am sure that the majority of you out there were the latter, wanting more and more. I kept looking for the ending titles, so I could end this violent blood-bath of a movie.CMRS gives Fight Club': 1 (Bad Film)\n",

            "No doubt, Fight Club is one of the best films of the decade and it deserves its overwhelming good reputation. Edward Norton plays his second-best role after his terrific performance in American History X and Brad Pitt does best in dark and bizarre films so he is absolutely right in Fincher's masterpiece. From the beginning it becomes clear that this is no film for people who just want to relax in their seat with some popcorn and a cola trying to spend a smooth evening. You really have to think and this is what makes it a good film. A man is frustrated about his life and searches for something completely different. Honestly, that's not a very new idea but Fincher is able to give it a new direction. He radicalizes his characters and shows brutality in a direct and uncovered way. The perversion of society gets a face in Tyler Durden and the ones who follow his \"new way\". The narration is what impressed me most. Who are absolutely shocked when you have to realize that Tyler is not the one he seems to be... To give a conclusion: Not my favourite, but a very, very good film!\n",

Let us FOCUS on the Title´s Content and Context:Surrender to FIGHT CLUB...A No-Holds-Barred Knockout! If you haven't seen it...See it! If you HAVE...See it again! In the weeks after its release, either the critics just plain DIDN'T GET IT... Or shrewdly pretended not to! Considering Fight Club's tauntingly in-your-face Political INcorrectness, it's easy to see why most critics opted to play it safe!Here is a film that almost cries out, \"HATE ME! DESPISE ME!\" An occasional film will step gingerly on the toes of audience sensibilities. Fight Club drop kicks them!Yet, it is so relentlessly and quirkily original, so pathologically tantalizing...you will LOVE it...and then HATE yourself for it! Make no mistake, however, Fight Club always shows its audience ample respect. It never pontificates nor proselytizes, as would your typical formulaic Hollywood film.The term \"Ride\" is employed so freely to movies today, that it has become rather meaningless. Fight Club re-invents the word! Literally, from the DNA Roller-coaster opening Credits (Accompanied by the DUST BROTHERS musical equivalent of a sustained amyl-nitrate rush!), to the metaphoric wailing (\"We're still men!\") of castrated testicular cancer victims, to the mesmerizing and deftly parlayed 3-way screen chemistry of Norton-Bonham Carter-Pitt, to the sharply focused pointlessness of our cruise-control, hyper-consumeristic lifestyles......FIGHT CLUB synthesizes both our pent-up frustration and our self-induced reluctance to communicate it, in RULE #1...\"You DO NOT talk about Fight Club!\" This, Ladies and Gentlemen, is one \"RIDE\" you CERTAINLY DO NOT want to miss!10**********.....ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are most welcome!\n",

Anyways the movie is great. The direction was superb. All the actors were very suitable for their roles. Brad Pitt was great as always and I'm pretty sure that this is the best his movie. Same goes to Edward Norton (who is one of my favorite actors). Helena Bonham Carter did also a great job as Marla Singer. Just today by watching this film maybe 10th time in my life, I noticed that Bob is played by Meat Loaf, that was a very good choice in my opinion. I noticed that the sound effects in this film were very realistic. The plot was very twisted and interesting. Really worth watching film.\n",

            "Edward Norton plays an emotionally troubled guy with insomnia, who is also the narrator of the film telling his own story. It is difficult to talk about the story because everything is so good that talking about anything feels like a spoiler. One thing for sure, the story is intelligent, entertaining and connects with the audience on both intellectual and animalistic levels. The believability of the plot does go down a little towards the end of the film, but who cares? The message of this movie is most interesting. It is not a new message but it is given a while new life in this movie. The first half of the film seems to show one point of view, a fairly popular point of view in the modern world, but it is later contradicted by the results of the main character's action.Even little bits in this movie can be brilliant, in fact, especially the little bits. You blink too long and you miss them, though the movie does a real good job at keeping your attention so you should not miss things too easily. Prepare to have your eyes glued to the screen in a semi-voluntary manner.The film looks amazing. It has a gritty and wonderfully disturbing look to it. There is a texture to everything. Even the people's clothes, it seems, were picked to invoke a specific feeling of texture.A lot of the film was shot at night in the city or in locations that are dimly lit and the film uses all those night lights to great atmospheric effect. So the movie, despite being gritty and textury, also ends up being really colorful. There are also some computer generated effects but they are used sparingly and to great effect, bending the viewer's mind.The dialogue is edible. If for nothing else, this what you come for. Every line is sharp and sober and hangs on to your brain with a steel hook. It really pays to see this movie somewhere where you can stop and rewind it because, like with its cinematography, the lines do not stay for long and you may miss something tasty.This is probably also Brad Pit's best role. The guy has never disappointed, but this looks like his masterpiece, like he is working his hardest and having the greatest fun doing it. Edward Norton has always had a docile delivery so he complements the insane Brad Pit very well.Perhaps my one problem is Helena Bonham Carter. It is not even her acting, which is quite good. It is the look. It is a mystery why that actress has to have the same appearance in every movie and in real life: The kooky Tim Burtonesque black-clad emo chick with wavy messy hairJust...paint the hair redor blueanything! The things is, it must be admitted that her look fits her role in this movie very well, so there is that.Also, it may be useful to point out, as the title of the movie very explicitly suggests, this movie is largely male oriented. Its bluntness, its grossness, its violence, most of its actors and even its themes are catered to guys.Fight Club is a movie for the history books. It is quite hardcore and definitely male oriented, which may limit its audience, but it is also brilliant in so many ways. Fight Club is quite possibly the most entertaining movie of all time.\n",

            "I knew the ending to Fight Club before watching it and I just wish I could go back and not find out.   But I was still not going to be phased out and just get on with it and enjoy.  I still didn't know the exact end only the twist in it.  When people usually tell me there is a twist in films then it is more obvious when it happens but I don't think anybody could have predicted Fight Club's dark twist unless they had read the book in advance.We should be really hating The Usual Suspects, Seven and Fight Club because these films made twists what they are today and that unstoppable.  Don't get me wrong I loved the twists in those films just as much as you do but it gave writers all the world the idea that every script in the world should involve twists.  There are some good ones but in most they are obvious and not original.   Fight Club took you into this story which made sense at first and quite normal but we were just getting fooled to what eventually happened in the fatal twist of events.   Edward Norton is the greatest actor in this film and Brad Pitt is the coolest with Helen Boham cater as the dirtiest which has to be said because she is a skank. David Fincher's direction is as good as always and never stops to be more than amazing till Panic Room of course.What I didn't like about fight Club was how Fight Club changed from underground basement fighting to operation Mayhem without any real explaining why.   Tyler does say something which is excusable but it wasn't enough.  In the book they do it and I think it was very vital to explain it in the movie but of course it wasn't which I think is a mistake on the writers part.   Someone told me there was a deleted scene which explained it a bit more thoroughly but it was obviously missed in the final cut.   Apart from that Fight Club is as perfect than any film is ever going to be.\n",

            "I am Jack's Fight Club movie review.When I first saw this at the cinema I liked it, but didn't quite absorb it all. After watching it several more times on DVD, I have now discovered how good it really is. The opening trip through the brain is amazing. The film quickly gathers pace and never lets up, as we listen to Jack the narrator, played by Edward Norton. He describes his life has having all the material things, a nice condo, nice furniture, he doesn't have any monetary worries. But Jack needs something different to enliven his life.After going to many health help groups to seek solace for his insomnia, he meets a bold character in Tyler Durden (played with relish by Brad Pitt), a soap salesman who becomes friendly with Jack. One night outside a bar, the two guys decide to have a fight, what the heck it's different they say. After this initial scrap, the two guys start their own underground fight club, and the membership expands rapidly. It seems there are many young men out there who want to fight. After some brutal fight scenes, Tyler starts Project Mayhem, whose purpose is to disrupt corporate buildings, and to generally cause mayhem.The other pawn in the film is Marla Singer, played by Helena Bonham Carter, who sleeps with Tyler and annoys Jack. The distrust between Jack and Tyler finally erupts into a frenzied finale, as the the surprising outcome is revealed. The film throbs with energy, style and an enigmatic spirit. After Seven and The Game, Fight Club reinforces David Fincher as a talented director.I am Jack's The End.\n",

            "The 90's had a bunch of excellent movies, such as, ''The Shawshank redemption'', ''Se7en'', ''Forrest Gump'' and, of course, many other movies, Fight Club being the greatest masterpiece of 1999 to top it all.Fight Club was a unique movie, which in my opinion is the father of the excellent movie ''The Machinist'', because the idea is quite similar, both movies turning out great, of course.Many people know the movie by it's original, at the time, plot twist, where Edward Norton's and Brad Pitt's characters were really one person, Brad Pitt's character being the imaginary friend or the person who Tyler Durdan really wanted to be. The plot twist was interesting and quite shocking, but the greatest aspect of this movie, at least in my opinion, is really finding and doing whatever you really love to do in life. Tyler was a casual office worker, had a great condo, with everything he wanted, but that was a very sad life, he was always depressed, had insomnia, which lead him to join several support groups just to feel better about himself.Tyler Durdan's Fight Club was really a place for him to escape reality, even though not even knowing, that he was the head behind it all, he finally felt good about himself, despite the bad conditions he was living in. The people who joined his Fight Club were just like him, they had many problems and wanted to have some sort of redemption via that.An excellent movie, about one man and his broken mind. Everyone should have seen this movie, though only made in 1999, it has clearly went down in history as a classic. 10/10.\n",

Fight Club is all of those movies. A Satire/Social Commentary that discusses nihilism, consumerism that makes humans ultra-materialistic, post modern society where social conformity triumphs over individuality, emasculation of men, mental health, cult mentality & anarchism. Based on Chuck Palahniuk's highly applauded novel, David Fincher makes a Technical masterpiece, with so many scathing dialogues which will get etched onto your brain. The performances are phenomenal, Brad Pitt & Edward Norton play these polar opposite characters brilliantly. Camerawork, Direction, Music, Sound Design, Production design, everything is top notch here. I only felt the middle part was dragging a little. Unfortunately I knew about the big twist which definitely hurt my viewing experience. I have to watch it a couple more times to truly let the film sink in. A Must Watch.\n",

Fincher, a smoke and mirrors hack who is convinced that more is more, wants to sell you on the idea that we're living shallow lives. The proof's in the pudding here folks. He bashes you over the head with his \"themes\" like a college sophomore. He is a master of the odious, puerile 'wouldn't it be cool if this happened' school of story construction. The film is filled with desperate attempts at comedy, mostly of the gross-out, toilet variety - so no doubt the sub-20 dilettantes are enthralled - but the film is wall-to-wall form over substance. Most annoying are Fincher's pet signature moments - you'll see them in all his worthless work: mention a pilot light - and voilà, the camera flies around a stove and shows you a pilot light. Presumably he finds this is magical as he repeats it everywhere - but we know it's simply his unleashed attention whore personality being imposed where it doesn't belong. There's no need to 'spoil' the ending - it's obvious to any thinking person within the first 10 minutes what's going on. F-\n",

            "I'm not a sexist, but I believe the males would enjoy this movie much more than the ladies. This movie is very graphic with all the fight scenes, and I love that stuff. Ed Norton is tired of life and soon meets Brad Pitt, a fun and semi-crazy travaler. After they have a  fun mini brawl, they decide to create the fight club, the club designed to let men take out all their aggrestion on one another by brutally beating each other. But Ed Norton's character begins to realise that things aren't what they seem when a beautiful girl becomes involved. He doesn't know if it's coincidence, or deadly after- effects of his recent insomnia. This may seem to appear as just another violent beating movie, but it is oozing with other fun and mysterious twists and turns, so the viewer should pay huge attention to what's going on. The movie knocked me out, fantastic.   9.5/10\n",

            "David Fincher is one of the best directors in Hollywood today. This is his finest film.Based on the best selling book of the same name, the movie starts with the narrator,Edward Norton initially a nameless, boring drone leading a shallow, meaningless life as just another cog in the great corporate wheel. He spends his time buying sofa-sets and basically indulging in the huge facade that is today's materialistic and fake society. As he puts it: \"We used to read pornography, now it's the 'Horchow Collection'.\"But he isn't satisfied with his life. There's always this nagging feeling, deep-down, a hint of discontent. This manifests into his psyche and he becomes an insomniac. Seeking medication, he discovers therapy groups, and there, on the pretext of a terminal disease or an addiction, he cries. He doesn't really know why he crying. Maybe its about the hollowness, and the utter futility of it all. This daily discharge helps him sleep. Until, that is, chain-smoking, messed-up Marla Singer starts coming to his therapy sessions for a similar purpose. Seeing another 'tourist' there bursts the happy he finds himself in and insomnia creeps back into his life. Then he meets Tyler Durdan and he's drawn, like everyone else, to his magnetic personality. One night, on a whim, Tyler asks the narrator to hit him. He complies, and thus begins fight club. Fight club transformed into a nocturnal activity in a basement where men shed the inhibitions laid down by society, and release themselves. That's all that I'm going to reveal here.But let's talk about Tyler Durdan. For it's not possible to talk about fight club and not talk about Tyler Durdan, a character who was recently named the greatest movie character of all time by a magazine, beating out competition from the likes of Darth Vader, Hannibal Lecter, The Joker, John Rambo etc. Brad Pitt outdoes himself in portraying just about the best example of an alpha-male you'll ever see. Tyler epitomises the saying about Bond (\"Man want to be him, Women want to sleep with him\") more than any Bond. The rugged Daniel Craig, the cool suave and sophisticated Brosnan and Connery all fall flat in front of his sheer charisma. His laid-back, casual attitude tells of a man who has not a care in his life. The conviction with which speaks tells of a man who's got it all figured out. His radical thoughts and ideas tell of a fearless man, not afraid to go against society. And the small, condescending smile he occasionally afforded the narrator tells of a man who knows just how superior he is to everyone. Tyler Durdan acts the saviour of the society's repressed men and frees them from its clutches. Edward Norton too, does a brilliant job as the narrator, and his boring drawl as a narrative paradoxically draws you further in the movie. The narrator the quintessential modern man trying to find meaning who is swayed by forceful personality. The dialogues are smart and some of the lines have now achieved cult status and are often quoted to each other by today's hippys. The cinematography is completely in sync with the somewhat non-linear storyline and is so good that it somehow distracts most watching it for the first time (including me) from a very obvious truth which makes you feel really stupid afterwards. Because of this, Fight Club, has, for most of the stupid audience (which constitutes an incredibly large number of us) and also the ones who think they're too smart (the rest of us), a huge twist that leaves you gasping, adding to its excellent plot.In addition to the twist, the plot aptly puts a mirror to society. While the anti-consumerism propagated has been aptly covered by most reviewers, something that they missed was the movie showing how fickle and susceptible to propaganda the human population is, and who easily they get swayed in search of meaning.The film does tickle the fancies of many, despite the film's anarchistic messages being tempered down with wry humour. Fight club preaches about evolving beyond the endless pursuit of perfection by today's superficial society. Fight Club is about showing on your face what other people hide in their closets. Fight Club is about exposing the dirty underbelly that every household inevitably has. But it also preaches against taking its own ideas too extremely. But above all, it entertains. It is more than two hours of intense entertainment. For all those who haven't seen Fight Club, go watch it right now! 9/10\n",

            "Finally I saw the movie and I must say - I was IMPRESSED. I expected nothing more than an action flick (clearly I do not know Fincher 's style for real... it was my second Fincher film, and I will watch all after them! ) and it was so, so much more.Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that, with every viewing, gets even more complicated yet so simple that you can't help but laugh. There's the tiny issue of the story of Fight Club, penned by Chuck Palahniuk the story is nothing short of incredible, a pure shock-value social commentary on the state of the world at the end of the century. You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll do all the clichés but most importantly you'll identify with every single thing on the screen.FINCHER has an incredible skill of locking the viewer into the actor (by following EXACTLY the actor's movements, making the motion interlock with the acted-out emotions of the actors). He is a genius on using music, drama and humor each time it is needed... there is so many deep and light, humorous scenes, it is like a roller coaster.Each shot is well laid out and designed, always struck with detail, texture, color, composition to fit the actual message. Fincher is an EXPERT (as I read after) in blending in the FX / CGI into the real material, creating the best illusions that are better / deeper than reality - and it shows in the film. Each scene is detailed, but in a subtle way that does not give away it's secrets straight away.I love the set design as well, the choice of worn out buildings, glas high rise apartments, boredom-dripping office spaces - a believable world of US cities that still tells a nearly unreal suburbia vibe.This is perfection and I will rewatch this COUNTLESS times!\n",

            "The members of Fight Club are hopelessly pathetic junkies who believe self-destruction is the most productive way to counter their failures to be what society tells them they should strive to be, but who they didn't become.  In the world of Fight Club, there is no need for aspirations to achieve goals and dreams, so they resort to their counter-programmed, repressed sadistic tendencies for therapy.  But what does this accomplish? In the end, the answer is nothing  nothing more than one man's awakening from an eternal dream-state.  It is attempting to speak to the dazed and confused among us by way of the ridiculous notion that violence creates an understanding of oneself. The first two hours of \"Fight Club\" is a stark and vacuous rambling that plays out like a like a wannabe hard-core, tough-guy's movie for Gen Xers who think it's cool to watch grown men smack each other bloody.  And herein lies the irony  The film plays up the violence quotient to highlight its characters' worthiness, while we the audience (presumably) cheer these guys on vicariously through cinema, all the while distanced from the film's `your id should dictate your being' holy-otherworldliness.  We do not experience what it is like to be Tyler Durden outside the film's reality, and this hypocrisy is something he would frown upon.  Those of us not in Fight Club, are we not living? The film gets more ludicrous as it goes, pounding the audience over the head with the idea that an ever-increasing mass audience would continually embrace Fight Club, lead by a loser who succumbs to his dual-personality disorder.  But maybe that's the point  we, the audience, are the newest members of Fight Club, and we are the victims of a brutal beat-down on our first night.  But we are entertained by it nonetheless.  Fight Club is an attack on our senses and sensibilities, one that would make even Tyler Durden jealous.  It is a knock on materialism, but a champion of irreverence.  Fight Club is an all-encompassing religion-like way-of-life, straight out of the school of hard knocks.  It is also a film who's main character must go through an epiphany of violent escapades and unconscious musings before he understands what any `normal' person on the street already knows  that life does offer possibilities and unspecified pinnacles of joy and enlightenment.  It does not take a wrong before one can understand productivity and do good. I don't think the film glorifies violence; in fact, it's conclusion puts to rest the edgy leanings that came before it, deploring violence, brutality, and self-destruction as a waste of time and human life.  However, morals cannot exist out of context, and the way the filmmakers present them results in an acidic residue inside the minds of the audience.  It used to be no blood, no foul; now it's no blood, no self-fulfillment.  I guess pain really is love.  The film's ultimate effect is one of wanting you to treat it as a non-sentimental, non-preachy statement on human behavior and aspirations, but lacks an excuse for us to do so.  Violence brings out the best in all of us, right Tyler?\n",

            "\"Fight Club\" is a film that went from unknown to a cult film realized for its smart satire to a film with a large following, but loved by many of the people that it satirizes. In a way, this progression reflects the progression of the fight club in the film itself.The film begins as seemingly a satire of consumer culture and our mundane lives. The main character has insomnia and is a slave to consumer culture and his boring 9 to 5 job where he hates his boss. The one frame inserts of Tyler Durden into the narrators boring life show his desperation to escape his routine. He is so desperate in fact that he starts going to support groups after his doctor recommends going to one to understand \"true pain\". He realizes that when people are dying they are so raw and truthful and just don't care about the trivial things that he does, and it makes him feel better. He begins to start sleeping well but a woman that does the same thing as him shows up, except she does it simply because it costs less than a movie and has free coffee, but she reminds him of his own lie. The narrator explains that she knows that she could die at any moment, therefore she does what she wants. His insomnia starts up again. He confronts her and they exchange numbers. From here, it starts to show the narrator wake up on planes in places that he doesn't recognize and he doesn't remember how he got there. He meets various normal people on planes that he calls \"single serving friends\". The most interesting one, however is Tyler Durden. He is cool, different, anti- establishment, and completely aware of all of the trivial things in our daily lives. He points out that there are many safety devices on planes that only exist to make us feel safer. When all of the narrators belongings go up in flames in an apartment fire, he calls Tyler. He doesn't know why, but we know it's because Tyler is subconsciously what the narrator wants to be. While the narrator is sulking about his lost belongings, Tyler shows his distaste for consumer culture. He knows \"what we own can end up owning us\". When they walk outside, Tyler tells the narrator to hit him. Tylers logic is that if he's never gotten in a fight before then how would he know if it was a good thing or not. They fight, and the narrator begins to feel liberated from his boring routine. He moves into a broken down home, and begins to fight more with Tyler. More people see them fighting one night and join. Eventually there is a whole club. Tyler establishes rules (rule number one, you do not talk about fight club), and so far, all this seems logical enough. For one I've never been in a fight, so I wouldn't know how it could feel, and two, I'm sure all of us have thought of breaking from the usual routine. Also, most importantly, Tyler seems cool and smart. But one night when Tyler holds a gun to a man's head, but spares him, and tells him to become a veterinarian (what he is currently in school for) in the next six weeks or he will be dead. We are shocked at first, but Tyler not only gave this man motivation to do what he wants to do with his life, and as he explains \"that mans breakfast will taste better than any other meal we have ever had\". It sounds logical, he made that man appreciate life, but as the next scene shows, he is manipulating us as well as the people in the film. He looks directly into the camera and tells us what he later tells his army as we see the edges of the film roll. We then realize how hypocritical and insane this all is. It is an anarchist and anti- establishment group whose followers are even more brainwashed than the consumers that they were originally mocking. They have a large list of rules and do mindless work and terrorist attacks for a leader that controls them completely. It is both a satire of consumerism and daily life as we're told to live it and the anarchists that it inspires. What it suggests is a balance in which you are not made numb by the mundanes of everyday life, and you don't buy brand name furniture and appliances to make you feel like you have meaning, but you also shouldn't become anarchistic to escape your lifestyle to the point of inciting meaningless violence and having cult like activities. This balance is suggested by the narrator and Marla holding hands at the end.What elevates the film to a 10/10 however, is the commentary on the emasculation of men (specifically through testicular cancer), and what that does to them, and how they come to grips with that. I won't go in depth, as this is already going long, but the very end is great, where the narrator holds Marla's hand as the buildings in front of them collapse, while their pose and clothes mirror each other, with narrator seemingly wearing a dress, showing that he has accepted his feminine side. But, back with the other satire of the film, Tyler seems to have the last word as he corrupts the film, which is ultimately a commercial product (there is even a Pepsi ad in the film as well as noticeable product placement), by inserting a few frames of a penis.\n",

            "Fight Club really deserves the right to be called a 90s classic despite premiering at the end of the decade. The style of this movie fits in with it's time - the music, costuming, lighting, and cinematography really helping with this. The concept itself is of course the ultimate highlight. The idea of this secret society revolving around people beating each other up evolves to reflect flaws of society that are still pretty relevant 20 years later.While the writing can surely speak for itself, the cast really delivers excellent performances that bring these characters to life. Brad Pitt as the very charismatic rebel, Tyler, is a true stand out. Helena Bonham Carter as Marla is a wonderful supporting character. Of course, Edward Norton is the center as the Narrator. He displayed the character's development wonderfully as this miserable office worker takes a plunge into a new perspective on life.What really puts Fight Club up there as one of the greatest movies of all time is the big twist at the end. Spoiler alert, but the Narrator was suffering from multi personality disorder big time, his other personality being Tyler. As someone who knew nothing about the film, the movie does a great job at hinting this, while not explicitly revealing anything until the last 20 minutes. I thought it was odd when Marla was wondering around the house that you never saw her or Tyler in the same room. That's when my suspicions began.I was definitely more suspicion after my favorite scene when Tyler talks about his job at the movie theater. This is the the only scene that breaks the 4th wall beside the narration throughout. That whole concept of replacing a frame in a movie was such a great parallel to what was going on inside his head, and the fact that both guys were there explaining it validates this. Not to mention, in the beginning, I did catch a few flashes of who I'm guessing was Tyler, as if the director of Fight Club replaced a single frame to insert Tyler in the background before Tyler is introduced. And once it's all put out in the open and explained, all the build up is very satisfying.\n",

Fight Club may be iconic and technically proficient, but it's more distant than perhaps any film to attain \"modern classic\" status. The trajectory of Fight Club is baffling. In its first hour or so, this picture appears to be a gloriously spiteful and well-acted satire of our bogus contemporary \"crisis of masculinity\": self- pitying guys hugging in groups and claiming victim status - modern consumer society having allegedly rendered the poor dears' hunter- gathering instincts obsolete. But, by the end, it has unravelled catastrophically into a strident, shallow, pretentious bore with a \"twist\" ending that doesn't work. And it is a film which smugly flirts, oh-so-very- controversially, with some of the intellectual and cultural paraphernalia of fascism - but does not have anything like the nerve, still less the cerebral equipment, to back this pose up.Edward Norton gives a compulsively twitchy, nerdy, hollow-eyed performance as Fight Club's Narrator: a 30-year-old single guy with a white collar job in the automotive industry and a secret addiction; he loves attending support groups posing as a sufferer. Hilariously, this is the only thing that gives him an emotional high.\n",

            "Let's get it straight people: Fight Club was about one man's mid-life crisis; the way he got past feeling helpless with his work and love life. That's it; that's the summary. Now I can go on....SPOILER    SPOILER    SPOILER    SPOILER    !!!!!!I've commented on this film before but since then , like  A BILLION (no offense, but) mind-numbingly *STUPID* comments have been entered about why the film's ending \"didn't make sense\" or \"brought the movie down\", or  \"to be anti- Corporate America is too easy\"....whatever, shut up already; you've missed the whole point! About THE ENDING:Guys, Tyler is NOT REAL. We all realized that he is a fictional character in the Narrator's head. Now, that being said, the narrator's also got a horseshoe up his ass, because he's been pretty damn lucky up until that point; being beaten up every day and starting Project Mayhem w/out getting killed or arrested. Not even getting fired! Getting eveybody on his side! For a split-personality disorder sufferer, this guy has got some positive force on his side. Could it be within himself? Where Tyler has become unrelentingly powerful and threatening to the Narrator by the film's end, could it be that there is another character opposite of what the narrator was; a strong person, willing to survive and care and live life to it's fullest? This is the narrator's new outlook on life, Marla changed him and forced him to grow up.When he shot Tyler, he believed he was shooting himself, tbus killing his mind, thus killing Tyler. What people don't realize is that this other force, the one that began seeing that Tyler was too over-the-edge, the one that started to like Marla, TOOK OVER when he shot himself with that gun. So he shot himself in the ear/mouth instead of the head, because there was the will to live. When Tyler is present, you can't take what you see at face value, bc there are no other witnesses. When Tyler breathes out smoke b4 dying, that is the Narrator's mind thinking he has killed that demented, egotistical side of him to get past this mid-life crisis and to be able to understand women and to fall in love with one.Another thing : the entire movie is always hinting that today, men go through mid-life crises at a younger age. The narrator just went through his, and we got to see it!\n",

            "\"Fight Club\" is difficult to watch. It is filled with violence for violence sake without any redeeming qualities. Norton is a youth looking for a change of life style at an early age. Pitt plays a vulgar young man with pure violence on his mind. He infects his contacts with the same concept of life. Scene after scene is filled with blood and gore. Most of the violent behavior is purely hand to hand combat as in real boxing. If the author meant for us to be turned off by the physicality, then he has succeeded. The pace is frenetic, and the acting is just as fast. I could not give this cinema a high score simply because of the dark, depressing mood it exudes without projecting some sort of uplifting characteristic's.\n",

The storyline is based around a man that is, well kind of insane and lonely and needs something to do- which results in him finding groups to belong to at night after work- like AA and such. There he meets some people whom he builds relationships with.. and the story gets crazier. His day job is he flies throughout the country and does safety checks for vehicles throughout the nation. Thats where he meets Tyler. Tyler introduces him to fighting and the story just goes from there. This is a classic film.\n",

            "A young man finds escape from his boring job, frustrations, alienation, and lack of identity through a underground fight club.  The problems ensue when it becomes even more complex and dangerous than at first perceived.The story rather sharply looks at the very thin line between the mainstream and the underground.  How conformity and the American dream can actually be the catalyst to nonconformity and the American nightmare. It astutely examines the fact that there is a lot of unrecognized ticking time bombs right here in our midst.  The problems with the film really lies in the direction, which runs both good and bad.Finchers direction is good in that he matches the bleached out color of his print with a almost in your face analysis of the degeneration of his characters, with almost no let up.  He also includes some 'subliminal messages', which are kind of fun. (so pay attention!)His direction is bad with his overuse of dazzling camera work and computerized effects.  This should only be used if it can help accentuate the scene or define a character, but here it does nothing but drown out the story and make it look like a video game instead of a movie.  Having the camera glide thru the garbage in someone's trash can is nothing more than indulgence by the director to boast his cutting edge technological prowess. Also with all of todays 'advanced' effects it's amazing how easy it is to tell when it's been computerized.  For instance the penguin (another example of unnecessary indulgence) the second you see him you know he's been generated and is not real.It's interesting that out of all their effects only two things seem to remain.  The rundown, abandoned house the two men live in leaves the most lasting impression and the scene with the exploding skyscrapers looks as tacky as any 50's Japanese Godzilla flick.  You may have come a long way baby, but you still have a long way to go.The plot has too many quirky and unnecessary story lines and characters (especially Carters) that almost make it convoluted.  The scenes hopscotch between savage humor, gritty drama, and psychological thriller.  Put together and they tend to contradict each other and hurt the overall cohesion.  Although it stays metaphorically strong it becomes so overly exaggerated that by the end it losses it's overall  impact.  In fact the ending is kind of like killing a ranting lunatic.  Your just glad it's over so it can't get anymore wildly incredulous than it already has.Meat Loaf has his finest role since ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW playing the unforgettable Robert Paulson.\n",

            "It's been over two months since I went to see it, and my feelings towards the film are still somewhat mixed. Part of me feels repelled by the graphic violence (I winced several times), but another part wishes I'd directed it myself.The film has been compared to \"A Clockwork Orange\". Granted, it's not quite as good, but it sure sticks in your mind, I'll give it that. Certainly one of the most daring movies ever made, FC never backs down or pulls any punches, but constantly pushes the envelope. It's a love-it-or-hate-it affair, but whatever your feelings, you can't deny the dazzling technical skill displayed by David Fincher. The camerawork and editing is first rate, although perhaps a bit too flashy at times.The acting is pretty damn good. Brad Pitt delivers his most memorable performance (his best since \"12 Monkeys\"), and Edward Norton is simply superb. He is one of the great actors of our time. Helena Bonham Carter also comes off brilliantly. I found her both attractive and repulsive-a VERY difficult balance to pull off.Once, I took a mass media class, and they showed this awful video showing two crabby old men whining about how much violence there is in the media. I can only imagine what they would say about FC, they would certainly seperate content and context and miss the point entirely. It's very violent, yes, but it's not there for it's own sake. It's a statement on alienation and miscontent in today's society.\n",

            "I really like the work of David Fincher. I think Seven is one of the most beautifully crafted psychological thrillers in movie history. However i think Fight Club qualifies to be put in a whole different league than traditional movies. A movie like Fight Club, that manages to find and maintain it's coherence while dealing with profound subjects like existentialism and nihilism with dark humor and pretty violent action scenes (some fight scenes are very violent and bloody), is really hard to find. In fact for this reason is that i think that it should be qualified in a whole new perspective, because there are very few movies it could be compared to. The movie is about a guy who is really bored with his yuppie bureaucratic lifestyle but finds relieve when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who teaches him valuable life lessons. The fun of the movie is that this lessons are little by little unraveled while them (and later in the movie, their followers too) engage in brutal fist fights as a way of dealing with their issues with modern society. This fist fights then start becoming other activities increasingly more self-destructive. The beauty of the movie is that everything is extremely well done, from the cinematography (dark scenarios, surreal and practically dream-like sequences) to the soundtrack (great choice of music that enhance the dark feel of the movie) and the script (the dialog is great, conversations between the characters feel real and energetic: such a great dialog is hard to find in modern movies). And let's not forget about the performances, Ed Norton gives a great performance about a man whose boredom in life is so powerful that the only way he feels alive is by engaging in brutal fights with other desperate males. Brad Pitt gives what i think is the best performance of his career, playing the energetic but increasingly self-destructive and anarchistic Tyler Durden- Great Performances, Great Movie\n",

Everywhere someone - some twisted mind - is out there to take control of emotionally vulnerable people and then channelize it to their own end. To make the connection with fascism clear, in one of the memorable scenes Tyler asks its recruits whether they have black shirts/jackets/etc - recall the Blackshirts of Mussolini URL = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackshirts . Take the Al-Qaeda, Lashkar or Hitler, Stalin all seem to have a basic lack of respect for human life and they all are like Tyler ... the only difference being Tyler (I mean Norton) tries to redeem himself in the end. Sure as hell we know rest of the Hitlers and his ilk never knew what they were doing ...And why just fascists ... even religious preachers, communists or just about anybody who is fanatic enough to convert others to his point of view with a crusaders zeal (to the point of trying to eliminate people if they do not convert) all come under the scanner in this brilliant movie.On a different note, for a long time I was under the impression that this movie is one of \"Fast and furious\" varieties ... am happy that ultimately I overcame my inhibition to see this masterpiece.\n",

            "As you might see from other reviews, \"Fight Club\" resonated strongly with a lot of people. To appreciate it fully one should really see it at least twice.It's a smart, beautifully crafted work which breaks barriers of normal narrative Hollywood fare. It's not for everyone (most every frame is saturated with high-octane testosterone), but if you've ever had that feeling of dissatisfaction in your life... the sense that you held back and/or wished you pushed yourself further- \"Fight Club\" will likely hit a chord.Like most of David Fincher's films, it's a very dark, violent and dreamlike movie, but \"Fight Club\" also has quite a lot of humor in it. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are perfect in their mirrored characters as is Helena Carter as the edgy girlfriend/sex object. Amazingly, with all the darkness, blood and grittiness- it's somehow extremely refreshing to watch... mainly because of the very primal way it addresses human behavior.Going into the theater, I didn't expect to like \"Fight Club\" all that much, but it quite simply blew me away. Although there are some very uncomfortable parallels to terrorist cells and destruction of buildings (it was made before 9/11), the main theme is wonderfully compelling.For me it's all about what we often deal with in life (and a theme which many movies try to express) and that is- death. More specifically, the fear of death. As in one of my other favorite movies, \"Defending Your Life\", it addresses how fear can handicap our ability to truly enjoy the short time we have on earth- and how, when we allow ourselves to loosen the reigns, we worry less and live more fully. Whereas \"Defending Your Life\" expresses the point in a comedic way, \"Fight Club\" is right in your bloody f@*%ing face with it.Fincher seems to do his finest work with Brad Pitt -as I think this and \"Se7en\" are his best films to date.\n",

            "as you might see from other reviews fight club resonated strongly with a lot of people to appreciate it fully one should really see it at least twiceits a smart beautifully crafted work which breaks barriers of normal narrative hollywood fare its not for everyone most every frame is saturated with highoctane testosterone but if youve ever had that feeling of dissatisfaction in your life the sense that you held back andor wished you pushed yourself further fight club will likely hit a chordlike most of david finchers films its a very dark violent and dreamlike movie but fight club also has quite a lot of humor in it edward norton and brad pitt are perfect in their mirrored characters as is helena carter as the edgy girlfriendsex object amazingly with all the darkness blood and grittiness its somehow extremely refreshing to watch mainly because of the very primal way it addresses human behaviorgoing into the theater i didnt expect to like fight club all that much but it quite simply blew me away although there are some very uncomfortable parallels to terrorist cells and destruction of buildings it was made before  the main theme is wonderfully compellingfor me its all about what we often deal with in life and a theme which many movies try to express and that is death more specifically the fear of death as in one of my other favorite movies defending your life it addresses how fear can handicap our ability to truly enjoy the short time we have on earth and how when we allow ourselves to loosen the reigns we worry less and live more fully whereas defending your life expresses the point in a comedic way fight club is right in your bloody fing face with itfincher seems to do his finest work with brad pitt as i think this and seen are his best films to date\n",

The narration given by Edward Norton is powerful and haunting, and it makes the suspense and terror seem that more realistic. This is the kind of movie where you cannot tell the story to others too much without giving the whole movie away. The ending is one of the best I have ever seen in a movie since Usual Suspects. This is a powerful movie which will make you believe that chaos can end all existence. I think EVERYONE should see this movie. It is gruesome and violent at times, but it's worth it! It's a shame that I can only give it 5 stars. It really should be 100 stars, or even more! Fight Club is without a doubt one of the best movies ever made!\n",

            "The movie was directed by David Fincher, also responsible for the twisted masterpiece Se7en, and revolves around the main character who for all intensive purposes will be called \"The Narrator\", played by one of my favourite actors: Edward Norton. The Narrator meets a man named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who goes on to completely change his outlook on life, opening him up to what is truly his full potential, and encouraging him to leave behind his old monotonous life and \"just let go.\"It's difficult to explain why Fight Club is the incredible experience it is without spoiling anything. The main misconception is that the movie focuses on fighting, which is a fair assumption, based upon the name, but it is almost inexcusable to disregard it without delving a little deeper. About one tenth of the film contains fighting, with the remainder telling an unforgettable story of self-discovery and leaving you as the viewer to raise some questions about yourself and precisely where you think your own life is going. It's clichéd with many highly- rated films, but Fight Club really is life changing if you allow it to be.It'd be wrong to review the film without touching on just how exceptional the acting is. Marla, (played by Helena Bonham Carter) is the embodiment of a wasted life, counting down the days till she dies. Her life, like The Narrator's, completely changes when she meets Tyler, providing even the most depressive character in the film a new way of seeing things. Brad Pitt plays Tyler perfectly, not caring at all how people see him and being his own man, something which he encourages The Narrator to do.The true reason Fight Club is so phenomenal as a film however is down to the fact it was made with the sole purpose of being watched again, thanks to the completely mind-blowing twist featured towards the end. I can't put in to words just how shocked I was after the first time I saw the film, leaving me to instantly need to see it again. If there was ever a reason to see Fight Club, the twist alone would be it.\n",

            "This is my humble Marxist review of Fight Club.Fight Club is about the conformist and materialist attitudes an individual must possess to be considered a productive member of society. In order to reject the narrow confines of his society, the Narrator, who begins the film as a typical drone, decides to do things that are anti-materialist. He destroys his fashionable home, refuses the insurance money he is due, and moves into a dilapidated house in a slum. Still, it is not enough for him to merely passively reject his society; he must lash out and show his contempt for it. He begins by fighting strangers, an action that is anathema to normal bourgeois people of the type he mostly interacts with. He eventually joins with working class people in an attempt to overthrow the oppressive upper class. Finally, he sees that his methods are likely to prove ineffective; yes, the society to which he belongs should be rejected but his followers follow him blindly; they are just as guilty of being conformists as the people he worked with before. If they are put in power, they will rebuild society with all of the same problems-the only difference is that it will be even more brutal than it was before.If you are a student of history ( especially a Marxist) you will see how the Narrator's situation is a good metaphor for pretty much every revolution that has occurred over the last one hundred years; particularly the Bolshevik revolution in Russia.Fight Club lends itself to other interpretations; this is just one simple take on it.\n",

I always like Edward Norton a lot, for a change Brad Pitt gives a decent performance, and the plot is nicely twisted, but ultimately the movie is just dumb. I think that a movie like this can be more than an exercise in style only when the plot makes some sense. The plot in this movie makes no more sense than something like \"Atlas Shrugged\", so the movie is just high class junk. It's pretty hard to discuss the plot without putting in a spoiler, and since the key plot point wasn't obvious to me until shortly before it was exposed (and I had fun figuring out what was going on), I don't want to ruin it for other people. Just don't be fooled by the early part of the movie into thinking that it has anything deep to say.\n",

            "After hearing that this film was very good I decided to rent it. I was stunned. This movie combines great visuals with an excellent screenplay and is nicely topped with superb acting. The movie has a tendency to get weird, but not too weird. Norton is superb here, he gives great atmosphere with his narration and gives an excellent performance as a confused individual. Helena Bolham Carter is fine here, she acts like a suicidial, crazy person with good percsion. The real star here is Brad Pit whose performance in this movie is only equalled by his performance in 12 Monkeys. He adds such a great presence to Tyler Durden, its amazing. The only problem I had with this film is one Norton learns the \"deal\" with Tyler Durden, the movie loses its impact and becomes more of a hollywood type of movie. Concerning the rating, there are one or two heavy sex scenes, the occasional swearing, but I was surprised by the amount of violence. There isn't really that much, but when there is, it gets bloody. Really bloody. Unfortunately I knew the ending before hand, so not much of a surprise there. Fight Club combines ingenius storytelling to amazing visuals. Quite simply one of the best films ever made. 9.75/10\n",

            "This darkly comedic thriller, adapted from Chuck Palahniuk's novel, delves into the depths of modern masculinity, consumerism, and the erosion of identity in a hyper-capitalist society. With its incendiary themes, groundbreaking visuals, and unforgettable performances, Fight Club has become a touchstone for generations of filmgoers, challenging perceptions and sparking enduring conversations about the human condition.The film follows the story of an unnamed protagonist, a white-collar insomniac who finds himself disillusioned with his monotonous life and the superficiality of modern society. Seeking solace and release, he joins a clandestine fight club, a haven for men seeking physical and emotional catharsis. As the club grows and becomes more influential, it takes on a life of its own, morphing into a subversive movement that challenges societal norms and threatens to disrupt the very fabric of reality.At the heart of Fight Club lies the enigmatic Tyler Durden, a charismatic and enigmatic figure who becomes the protagonist's closest confidant and the embodiment of the club's anti-establishment ethos. Edward Norton delivers a tour-de-force performance as the protagonist, capturing the character's inner turmoil, existential angst, and gradual transformation into a revolutionary figure. Brad Pitt is equally captivating as Tyler Durden, exuding a dangerous charm and embodying the film's subversive spirit.Fincher's direction is masterful, creating a visually striking and unsettling atmosphere that complements the film's dark and disturbing themes. The cinematography is gritty and handheld, mirroring the raw and visceral nature of the fight scenes and the protagonist's descent into chaos. The editing is sharp and jarring, adding to the film's frenetic energy and sense of unease.Fight Club's exploration of masculinity is particularly noteworthy. The film challenges traditional notions of manhood, portraying men as trapped in a cycle of consumerism and emotional repression. The fight club, initially seen as a cathartic release, eventually becomes a breeding ground for violence and societal upheaval, reflecting the protagonist's growing alienation and disillusionment.The film's critique of consumerism is equally scathing. Fight Club exposes the superficiality and emptiness of a society obsessed with material possessions and status symbols. The protagonist's transformation into Tyler Durden mirrors the increasing commodification of identity in a world where self-worth is defined by what one owns rather than who one is.Fight Club's message is complex and often contradictory, reflecting the protagonist's own inner turmoil. The film is not simply a celebration of violence and anarchy; instead, it serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked masculinity and the destructive power of unchecked consumerism. It challenges viewers to question societal norms and confront their own sense of identity in a world that often feels increasingly depersonalized and alienating.With its groundbreaking visuals, thought-provoking themes, and unforgettable performances, Fight Club stands as a cinematic masterpiece that continues to challenge and provoke audiences today. It is a film that demands to be seen and discussed, not just for its entertainment value but also for its profound insights into the human condition in the 21st century.\n",

            "If you haven't seen it, and don't know others who have seen it, you probably think this is a movie that glorifies violence. And you'd be wrong. The movie is certainly charged with testosterone, but it is actually a deep, thought provoking movie examining the rampant consumerism of society versus ideas of nihilism and primitivism.The central figure to all the philosophizing is Tyler Durden, played to perfection by Brad Pitt. Durden is perhaps one of the most charismatic villains since Richard III, with eminently quotable sound bites that speak to the disillusionment in all of us. Pair that off with Ed Norton as a sardonic narrator, at first a wreck lost to the 'IKEA nesting instinct' and rendered cynical by the amorality of his job, and we have a scathing indictment of the consumerism smothering society.The bloody underground boxing of the Fight Club is a way the characters can gain control of their life, break free of the bonds society shackles them with. This in turn becomes Project Mayhem a terrorist organization aiming to send society 'back to zero.' In one chilling scene, Tyler evokes his dream world from the shadows: a world of post-apocalyptic proportions where people worry about things that matter--i.e. survival. Clearly, the violence has escalated beyond the point where it makes sense, but at the same time we can't shake the truth beyond Tyler's words, the desire to live one's own life.The film doesn't tell you 'do this' or 'do that.' It just asks you to think.(Some may be put off by a few plot holes the twist creates. These are actually fewer than they first appear, and further, the film is not the poster child for realism. Just ride with it.)\n",

Fight Club possibly has one of the biggest, and most amazingly executed, twists of all time. The Sixth Sense had an amazing twist as well, but it was much easier to see coming. I actually suspected that something was amiss long before it happened and by the reveal I knew it was coming (though I might not have if not for one brief shiver). But this movie actually got me! That is so rare that it deserved the extra star for that alone.That aside this movie is fantastic and is a true gem of a movie.

Of course the anarchist in your face plot and the anti-hero's cool demeanor make this a hugely popular film, especially among young disillusioned men. The film itself is brilliantly paced, reeking of humor and brilliantly shot. The acting is top notch. Ed Norton is relatable as the narrator and Brad Pitt shows why he was so popular back in the 90s- he owns the scenes. Ladies get a strong character in Helena Bonham Carter's Marla Singer, though quirky and psychotic. But then everyone is that way to some extent in this stylish film.

            "As much as I admired the ambition and uniqueness of \"Fight Club\", I couldn't force myself to like it.  It's dark and gritty atmosphere felt like it was borrowing a little to heavily from \"Taxi Driver\" and films of that like. The plot twist at the end was interesting, as was the story in general. What bothered me was the direction.  There were some brilliantly made scenes, but a lot of them felt a little silly - almost like Fincher was trying too hard to be fast-paced \"MTV generation\" style.  On top of that, some of the dialogue, especially Tyler Durdan's was poorly written - especially in cases where he was meant to throw in little witty remarks. Pitt's performance was weak, especially put up against Ed Norton, who was impressive, as usual.  Thematically, the bottom line is that, when all was said and done, this movie had no idea what it was about, and suffered because of it.  Fincher is a superb talent, but this is not his best showcase - \"Se7en\" was a much better application of his style.\n",

            "The male world just got with this film its ultimate masterpiece, it will even make guys laugh, think, and even cry. Yeah, \"Fight Club\" can do that to any man to watch these unforgettable 2:19 hours of pure excitement! \"Fight Club\" is a testosteronic classic to be remembered, the title just sounds like a fight film, but who thinks that are wrong, the movie goes much deeper than that.The story begins with this guy (Edward Norton), who during the movie never says or mentions his name. He works at a car agency and spends its life in the office. He suffers from insomnia and doesn't know what to make of his life felling an immense and deep hole. Then he begins attending therapy groups to be able to express himself and put everything out and always have company. In one of these groups he meets and \"falls in love\" to the weird smoking Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) who happens to have the same trend he attending several therapy groups. One day, during a business trip he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). The guy and Tyler have the same thoughts about life and what to do with it, then both start a strong friendship and arrange a new form of therapy, a male therapy which consists in beat the crap out of each other (in other words, fighting). Then they create \"Fight Club\", which attracts many followers to this male therapy where men in the middle of a fight can unleash all his anger and anguish that he carries, it doesn't matter of his going to win or not. But the club is just a much bigger plan that Tyler plans by every passing minute.The film, as the title says is about a Fight Club, but the film not only focuses attention on fighting scenes (which are many). But through this club, Tyler tries to convey his major criticism of society. The film raises a number of criticisms and questions about the society we live in and how dirty it is, these criticisms come to us through the constant black humor and male philosophy leaving us thinking for days.The writing of Jim Uhls (screenplay) is superb, explores our society through dialogs and breathtaking scenes, and the direction of David Fincher makes it all fantastic.\"Fight Club\" is the testosteronic masterpiece to be remembered forever, thanks to a fantastic writing and direction and superb performances from both Brad and Edward leaves the film just MAGNIFICENT.\n",

            "It's not often that a major motion picture can be described as above -- and Fight Club is all that and more.  It's a highly stylized look at the difficulty people have in connecting to the world around them.  The Narrator suffers from insomnia, but in reality he's been asleep his entire life, lullabied by consumerism and low expectations.  All that changes when he meets Tyler Durden and a borderline psychotic named Marla.While the violence is graphic, it is not the end-all and be-all of this movie, and to that extent the title does the movie a bit of a disservice. There are a lot of punches thrown and the screen violence is realistic, but there's very little of any other kind of violence until you get to the last twenty minutes or so.  What I find refreshing about it is that the consequences of the violence are shown realistically as well.*** SPOILERS AHEAD -- BE WARNED! ***The film is ultimately nihilistic, anti-materialistic, and anti-social; did anyone else note that the initials for Fight Club (FC) were the same used by Ted Kaczynski as the Unabomber in his manifestos?  Think of the Unabomber's philosophies and you'll get an idea where Durden is going with his plans.I will note that the twist at the end (and since \"The Usual Suspects\", all films have to have an identity twist, don't they?) was telegraphed by the flash appearances of Durden in several early scenes.  This may be more apparent when viewing the DVD, as I did.  I noticed what I thought was a film flaw, backed up, and ran the scene one frame at a time.  This is used in several places in the film, and there's a notable one in the last few seconds, if you're into that kind of thing.  It's also set up well in the movie.An excellent film, somewhat undone by the clumsy handling of the twist, but the performances are first-rate.  A dark, funny, and nihilistic adventure for the brave.  9 out of 10.\n",

In my years of practice I have noticed a trend in movies and on television making a joke out of mental illness. In my non- expert yet vocal opinion, Schizophrenia can be a very serious, if not properly treated, disease. If combined with other disorders, such as Psychosis and Intermittent Explosive Disorder it could be used to provide quality entertainment and comedy to the masses.The movie starts out with our main protagonist, trying to convince his new \"friend\" to engage in a Narcissistic playtime setting. It starts going well as they engage in friendly beatings and torture. They recruit homeless people with the same mindset and start gambling out the outcomes. The more beatings our hero gets the worse his psychosis becomes and snowballs into a trip to a mental hospital, where he lives out the rest of his days...locked forever in a room with an overgrown native American and bars of human soap.I recommend a viewing with an open mind, and a few beers.\n",

            "Depends on that I've been watching one of David Fincher's films recently I've decided that I should go ahead and talk about Fight Club. Or shouldn't I? That is if you're into Fight Club in real-life just for fun just to hang out with your mates and such. Like when you're having a sleepover or getting drunk. The only reason I'm interested in seeing this is because, One: I've watched one of the films by David Fincher, Two: I see that this movie is one of the highest rated films of all time in many movie websites including IMDB. And Three: This is right up there with The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Schindler's List, Pulp Fiction, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Forrest Gump, Inception and many more that were on top. This is one of those that you and other people must see before you die. Edward Norton plays the narrator with no name who is a ticking-time-bomb insomniac who is dissatisfied with his white-collar job. He forms a \"fight club\" with soap salesman Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt and becomes embroiled in a relationship with a destitute woman named Marla Singer played by Helena Bonham Carter. You know, I literally knew exactly that this is going to be one unforgettable experience with it's memorable quotes, strong performances, mesmerising editing and depth.\"Gentlemen, welcome to Fight Club. The first rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight Club is: you DO NOT talk about Fight Club! Third rule of Fight Club: someone yells \"stop!\", goes limp, taps out, the fight is over. Fourth rule: only two guys to a fight. Fifth rule: one fight at a time, fellas. Sixth rule: No shirts, no shoes. Seventh rule: fights will go on as long as they have to. And the eighth and final rule: if this is your first time at Fight Club, you have to fight.\"This takes something that you'd never expect especially in the third act. Controversy is what happens back in decades ago such as films, videogames and books. Like most movies that shocked audiences like A Clockwork Orange, The Exorcist and Trainspotting, they're out of their heads back in the day 'cause they got over them. David Fincher is a fantastic director. He's made some of the essential films back in the day from many films that I have not seen but seen something that I've already seen such his very first film and definitely the one that he hated that is Alien 3 and after that he made one of his memorable films such as Se7en, Zodiac, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl and of course, Fight Club. These films have all one thing in common that has being brought up a few times in recent years in regards to it's sex and violence. These films appeared to be somewhat heavy, those who could frequently say R rated and of course 15 and 18 rated movies. Brad Pitt does it again with his performance by delivering lines like you do not talk about Fight Club and telling Edward Norton's character to hit him and this is where Fight Club begins under the bar. \"I want you to hit me as hard as you can.\" Edward Norton as The Narrator who is somebody who can't get enough sleep, becomes insomniac and goes to the support groups where people suffering from testicular cancer. He starts to cry with Bob played by Meat Loaf. This movie revolves around anti-social behaviour, insomnia and one scene where Edward Norton and Brad Pitt tells you that there're cue marks at the side of the screen known as cigarette burns. This is something I've seen sometime as a kid. Anyways, Fight Club is a David Fincher masterpiece and I really enjoyed it for it's immense pleasurable experience. This is an amazing film. Really is just stunning all the way through. Very enjoyable. This is something that I will watch multiple, multiple times. If you don't like the film you are not special as what this movie really is. This is by far my favourite David Fincher film of all time. One of his memorable works by him.\n",

            "I think Fight Club is the most misunderstood movie of all time.  Many people think it teaches anarchy.  While, I admit the movie is violent, it is realistic.  That is what fights look like.  In movies, fights seem like easy, bloodless things where punches make loud noises which in real life don't happen.  On the anarchy thing, this movie reminds me of George Orwell's 1984.  The movie is not, repeat, is NOT to be taken literally.  The theme of the movie is not to do any of the things done in the movie.  It teaches not to be a follower, or in Tyler's terms, a space monkey.  Also, the movie, as far as the twist ending, is highly possible. It does take some understanding of human psychology, but just think of Psycho if you can't figure it out. While the critics hated this movie, I'm sure this will make a comeback and those same critics will add it to their top 10 lists.\n",

            "'Fight Club,' directed by David Fincher, stands as an unparalleled cinematic masterpiece that defies conventions and leaves an indelible mark on its audience. From the first frame to the last, this film is an adrenaline-fueled rollercoaster of emotions and a thought-provoking exploration of identity, consumerism, and societal disillusionment.David Fincher's direction, coupled with an exceptional screenplay by Jim Uhls based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel, creates an atmosphere that is both dark and captivating. The narrative follows the unnamed narrator (Edward Norton), a white-collar worker suffering from insomnia, who finds solace in support groups for various afflictions. His life takes a dramatic turn when he encounters the enigmatic Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), and together they form an underground fight club as a form of male bonding and rebellion against societal norms.The brilliance of 'Fight Club' lies not only in its gritty and visceral fight sequences but in its ability to seamlessly blend psychological depth with a gripping plot. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt deliver powerhouse performances, each bringing a unique energy to their characters. Norton's portrayal of the increasingly unhinged narrator is both captivating and unsettling, while Pitt's charismatic and anarchic Tyler Durden is a force to be reckoned with.The film's thematic depth becomes most apparent in its mind-bending twist, a narrative choice that elevates 'Fight Club' to a level of storytelling rarely achieved in cinema. The revelation forces viewers to reassess everything they thought they knew about the characters and the story, leaving a lasting impact long after the credits roll.Fincher's visual style, characterized by his meticulous attention to detail and innovative camera work, enhances the film's dark and gritty atmosphere. The cinematography, combined with the iconic soundtrack featuring The Dust Brothers, contributes to the film's immersive experience.'Fight Club' is not just a film; it's a cultural phenomenon that has left an indelible mark on the cinematic landscape. Its bold exploration of societal discontent, the nature of identity, and the consequences of unchecked consumerism continues to resonate with audiences. In a sea of conventional films, 'Fight Club' remains a beacon of originality and a testament to the power of storytelling in film.\n",

            "So I've read Chuck Palahniuk's \"Fight club\" and just wanna say a couple words about it first. This book is written in a very specific way, it's written almost without dialogs, yeah there is lines here and there but there no dialog it's like just a character says something then after a period of time, after some events are described, another or the same characters says something and so on and I loved this writing style. It really stands out and it shows something unique in Palahniuk, something we haven't seen before, something we see in all of his book. Also he puts a lot of great saying in the book that really lives you thinking. The book gives a couple of hints which basically, if you smart enough, unfold the ending long before it. And the last thing - the characters are really well done. So that's all about the book, know the movie. Is the movie following the book, is it as brutal and mind consuming as the book? Well actually yes, yes it is. So as for me the strongest point in the movie is the script, it sticks to the book and its few dialogs but also it brought as much as to Chuck to say that it's an improvement over the book(well actually I don't think so 'cause I prefer the original ending). I mean - how many script writers can do that? All the actors did a great job of making there characters look alive(although I still think that Norton gave his best performers in Primal Fear). Pitt and Carter is also awesome. So yeah the movie is brutal but there were some little, great things in the book that weren't in the movie which is a real bummer. From all two Fincher movies that I watched (Seven is the other) I think this is the best. Oh and yes Fincher did a great job as well. Watch the movie and if I convinced at list one person to read the book than my job is done.\n",

            "Fight Club is a dark, edgy masterpiece that challenges the status quo and pushes the boundaries of traditional storytelling. Director David Fincher creates a gritty, surreal world that explores the depths of the human psyche and the destructive nature of consumer culture.Brad Pitt and Edward Norton deliver powerful performances as the film's two main characters, Tyler Durden and the unnamed narrator, respectively. Their chemistry on screen is electric, and their interactions are both intense and thought-provoking. The film's supporting cast, including Helena Bonham Carter and Meat Loaf, are equally impressive, bringing to life the film's eccentric and memorable characters.The film's cinematography is stunning, with Fincher employing a gritty, industrial style that perfectly captures the film's themes of chaos and disillusionment. The film's soundtrack, featuring tracks from the likes of the Pixies and the Dust Brothers, adds to the film's edgy, rebellious feel.What makes Fight Club truly exceptional, however, is its willingness to explore difficult and controversial themes. The film's commentary on consumer culture, masculinity, and mental health is both provocative and insightful, challenging the viewer to examine their own beliefs and values. The film's iconic twist ending is both shocking and satisfying, bringing the film's themes and characters full circle in a way that is both unexpected and deeply satisfying.Fight Club is a masterpiece of modern cinema that continues to inspire and challenge viewers today. Its themes and ideas are as relevant now as they were when the film was first released, and its exploration of the darker aspects of the human psyche is both thrilling and thought-provoking. If you're looking for a film that will push you out of your comfort zone and challenge your perceptions, look no further than Fight Club.\n",

The narrator suffers the same problems like me, suffeeing in this capitalist world, buying things we don't need. And eventually the things we own end up owning us.As a solution, the narrator develops another personality, Tyler Durden, which is his dream personality. The narrator wants to be like Tyler i.e. cool, awesome and not shy to express his feelings but couldn't do so coz of the fear of this damn society. And this is probably one of the biggest plot twists of all time. The story is interesting and gripping and you\"ll surely relate to it. Both Brad Pitt and Edward Nortan has done great acting.Now, talking about the cons, the fight scenes should be longer and the ending seems incomplete or empty to me. But overall, Fight club is worth watching..:)\n",

            "Fight Club follows the story of the Narrator (Edward Norton) whose name is never mentioned, he is an employee of a car company who suffers from insomnia. The narrator attends a support group of testicular cancer victims and, after convincing them that he too is suffering from the disease, finds an emotional release that cures his insomnia. He becomes addicted to therapy groups and to the farce of posing as a victim, but the presence of another impostor - Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) - bothers him, so he negotiates with her to avoid meeting at the same meetings.After a flight home on a business trip, he finds his apartment destroyed by an explosion. She calls Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap salesman she had met on a plane, and they meet in a bar. A conversation about consumerism prompts Tyler to invite the narrator to stay at home. Tyler accepts on the condition that he is beaten. They both engage in a punching fight outside the bar, for the narrator to later move into Tyler's emaciated home. They continue to have more fights outside the bar, which attracts a couple of curious people. The fights pass into the basement of the bar, where a fighting club is formed governed by a set of rules.Fight Club is a black comedy and psychological film that manages to open your eyes to a reality that many ignore after paying attention to the material instead of living their lives. The satire about consumerism goes hand in hand with a dark comedy, touches of drama and suspense about who Tyler Durden is and to what end he does what he has to do. This almost unique piece shows us the wild and anarchist life of a group of \"knights\" who don't want to die without scars. It is not an example to follow, nor is it to initiate chaos or to be masters of disorder... Just don't forget The First Rule.\n",

            "There's certainly a lot to unpack with this movie and I will do my best to explain my thoughts and feelings on Fight Club. Is it a great movie? Yes. Do I like Fight Club? Yes. Is it a masterpiece? Yes!. There that's the easiest part of this review done and dusted. Now let's get to the meaty parts on what I view this movie to be aboutTo me personally and from what we have seen with The Narrator/Tyler Durden. It's about accepting the darker side we all inhabit within ourselves. Our subconscious. The side we refuse to let society or those we know and love see our real selves, our real thoughts and feelings. The side we try so hard to repress, pretend that it isnt there or ignore it completelyWe all have a darkness within ourselves, we are all capeable of evil atrocites. However, it is our moral codes, our surroundings, upbringing and will power that will either help keep our darksides in check or we let it consume us and turn us into monsters. For the character of The Narrator this very much applies to himThe Narrator is a blatant nihilist. His life has no meaning at all, he hates the world around him believing everything around him, his life and society means nothing. There's no point to anything in life other than to destroy and create chaos everywhere you go. Yet, as meaningless his life is he has tried to ignore, repress and pass off these thoughts into a different being that is Tyler DurdenTyler is everything The Narrator wants to be but lacks the will power to do so for a very long time. Tyler is fearless, brutal, domineering, charismatic and a leader. He wants to lead a revolution to destroy society by building up an army of outcasts and weridos of society who harbour similar tendencies all looking for direction and purpose in lifeIt later comes to a point everything Tyler has done is actually The Narrator himself. Little by little The Narrator finally gives into his darkness and nihilism. He doesnt want to believe it's him and even tried to stop his plan from coming to fruition even fighting himself ( Tyler) but because of how smart The Narrator is when he takes the Tyler personality, he is unable to foil his plans to blow up several financial buildings. Eventually he accepts himself for who he is becoming one with the darkness instead of trying to rise above it and go through with his planWe all need to realize we all have a side to ourselves we are not proud of with our negative thoughts on the world, strangers or those we know and love. We need to accept it and see it for what it is. Not let it bring us down or consume us. Simply by ignoring it, it's not going away but if we accept and embrace it but also not letting it take control. We face it head on and rise above it to become better peopleFight Club is also definitely a take on masculinity. What it takes to be a real man in the world we live in. Spirituality, emasculation, cult like mentality, nihilism, capitalism, existentialism crisis of finding our true purpose in life and who we should beOverall this movie is a masterpiece and one of the best movies I have ever seen. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt steal the show with their performances. It's brutal, interesting and thought provoking. For me personally it has given me somewhat of a deeper inside into The Joker's mind and how he sees the world.\n",

            "When first released, Fight Club was panned by most critics probably just because it was the safe thing to do.  Fight Club brings up many dangerous thoughts that might actually be true.  The film Fight Club is not only about the title club, it's also about a man's (Edward Norton) plunge into near insanity due to insomnia and can't seem to find a solution.  This was until he met the rebellious Tyler Durden.  Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is a man who is against everything that's materialistic and artificial.  This includes big business and models among other things.  Both men decide to come up with a club all men can work out their aggressions bearing the name Fight Club. Director David Fincher paints a dark and gritty film depicting a man's life spiraling out of control and the man who brings his life back into perspective (or so it seems).  The ending cannot be matched in sheer surprise.  Even \"The Sixth Sense\" cannot compare.  This movie requires repeat viewings and IMO is second to only \"The Matrix\" for the year 1999 . 9/10\n",

And who was most eager to receive that gift? Frat boys! Meat heads! Athletic uber-tools! Confused males with no idea what to do with their testosterone or intelects could give a collective and resounding \"I get it!\" after declaring that this was their favorite film. And there was nothing wrong with that because this was not a disposable Michael Bay juggernaut of ejaculate. It wasn't even a Tarantino powerhouse of poised pulp! No, this movie was challenging! Unfortunately, as much as society's chode children loved it, they didn't get the message. They didn't get it like the anti-establiSHAM grim and grime enthusiasts got it. You see, there is a truly provocative, truly subversive message to this film that just sweats insight and bleeds truth. That message? Life is not Disneyland, people! Oh no! You thought life was sunny and fun? Get off your Donny Osmond douvee and stop drinking that Yoohoo! Life is a dark, bleak, damp mess and everything that doesn't come from IKEA smells like fecal matter. Fight Club shows us that in this day and age, life is so terminally f***t that finding a support group without a voluptuous obese man is as likely as buying soap that isn't made from human fat. Fat Club ...ahem... Fight Club shows us that in this world, the only truth you'll find is the truth behind a punch to the face ...or the truth between Meat Loaf's mammaries. Never before or since has there been a film that so effectively told us that our lives had no meaning. Except for maybe Twilight! Keep up the good fist, Fight Clubbers!\n",

            "Where to begin? I loved Fight Club, along with many other people, and I would recommend it to anyone who has an 'open mind' and does not get offended easily. Fight Club had a dark feel, with very black comedy and a touch of mystery.Fight Club is about one man's journey through a weird part of his life. He (Edward Norton) has a good job working for a car company, he has nice IKEA furniture in his nice little condo. He was almost a complete man. Until, his condo explodes while he is away and he looses everything he owned. So, he rings Tyler (Brad Pitt), an acquaintance he made on a plane on one of his business trips. He goes and has a few beers with Tyler. After they finish they come out of the pub and Tyler asks him to hit him as hard as he can. After some hesitance he does, Tyler hits him back and they fight the night away. They get a buzz from fighting and that's how Fight Club starts. I won't give anything away but the story twists and turns ways you could never imagine.What made Fight Club so great was a combination of many different people doing a great job.  The novel buy Chuck Palahniuk was brilliant and I personally thought that it could never be brought to the screen and be as good as the book. But, Fight Club exceeded its limits and went a step further with a great screenplay by Jim Uhls, without the great screenplay the film would have flopped. Then there is the extraordinary acting all around, it was undoubtedly Edward Norton's, Helena Bonham Carter's and Brad Pitt's best performance ever and other small roles were played well too, such as Meat Loaf, playing Bob. And of coarse, last but not least, David Fincher. David exceeded all expectations making Fight Club. The film was given the prefect feeling thanks to David's precise direction, if you listen to the commentary and see all the extra features on the DVD you will be sure to know how much effort David put into Fight Club to give it the perfect feel, just like the book.Overall, Fight Club gives us some very strong messages, but I thing the very essence of the film is to take what you want from it. This is a must see for everyone, because in my opinion this is the best film ever made and you will most probably enjoy it. If you don't like it, watch it a second time, it will likely change you opinion. A definite: 10/10\n",

            "A great adaptation from an eloquently written novel. Two things that made this flick a crowning achievement are the screenplay and the performances.The movie stayed faithful to the book, thus the script was immensely entertaining and thought provoking. Every new line and scene they added fitted the source's messaging perfectly. That shows how much they understood the theme of the book. A paragon Hollywood needs to strive for when adapting a book.The crème de la crème of the actors for me was Ed Norton. Ed delivered in an astounding manner. His emotive performance on the hand burning scene and his beat up and tired features felt impressively authentic. The intensity of his voice changing to fit the lines messaging showed he understood the core gist of the book really well. That again shows his dedication for the role he was given. He was just the best man for the role.Helena Bonham was also perfect for Marla as she also seemed as miserable as her book counterpart. Brad Pitt's charismatic and self assured performance was also admirable. He went a wee bit boyish on some scenes but mostly did well so that makes up for his blunders.All the minor characters in fight club were incredibly convincing too. Movie was filled with a spectacular cast.Besides all that I wanna praise the stylistic editing , the phenomenal ending scene and the pixies song.Fight club is a superb and examplary adaptation that's constantly rewatchable. A gem that didn't disappoint fans of the book.\n",
